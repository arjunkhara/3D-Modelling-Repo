# MA Advanced Modelling and Animation 2018: Create a Piece of Interactive Entertainment in 3rd person in Unity (CW2)

This project documents the creation of the game '19-Fortuna' and my part, records, and reflections as project manager of the group. This document also serves as a submission for assignment 2 for Advanced Modelling and Animation (IS74023B) at Goldsmiths College, University of London. This  submission forms the individual write up component, presented in a development diary style, and records how the team was organised, key milestones and design decisions, assets, code, design material, and self-reflection on what worked well, what was less successful, what I may focus on next if I had more time, or what I would change if starting the whole process again.
