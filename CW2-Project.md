# MA Advanced Modelling and Animation 2018: Create a Piece of Interactive Entertainment in 3rd person in Unity (CW2)

This project documents the creation of the game '19-Fortuna' and my part, records, and reflections as project manager of the group. This document also serves as a submission for assignment 2 for Advanced Modelling and Animation (IS74023B) at Goldsmiths College, University of London. This  submission forms the individual write up component, presented in a development diary style, and records how the team was organised, key milestones and design decisions, assets, code, design material, and self-reflection on what worked well, what was less successful, what I may focus on next if I had more time, or what I would change if starting the whole process again.

## Introduction
19-Fortuna is a third-person game built in Unity by a group of seven members. The game centers around the narrative of a mech robot that mines for tholin crystals on the eponymous asteroid, (i.e 19 Fortuna). The asteroid, rich in tholin — a highly commodofied material on Earth — is also teeming with rock monsters who pose a problem for the mining mech. The mission is to drill as many tholin crystals as possible while avoiding the rock monsters. Armed with only a drill, and an electromagnetic pulse that generates when the mech appropriates a tholin crystal for use, the main strategy of the game is drill for minerals and avoid being attacked through motion mechanics in the game — strafing, dodging, and keeping out of proximity from the rock monsters. ![alt_tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/cw2-images/19-Fortuna.jpg)
