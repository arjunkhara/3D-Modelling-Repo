## 1. Introduction
19-Fortuna is a third-person game built in Unity by a group of seven members. The game centers around the narrative of a mech robot that mines for tholin crystals on the eponymous asteroid, (i.e 19 Fortuna). The asteroid, rich in tholin — a highly commodofied material on Earth — is also teeming with rock monsters who pose a problem for the mining mech. The mission is to drill as many tholin crystals as possible while avoiding the rock monsters. Armed with only a drill, and an electromagnetic pulse that generates when the mech appropriates a tholin crystal for use, the main strategy of the game is drill for minerals and avoid being attacked through motion mechanics in the game — strafing, dodging, and keeping out of proximity from the rock monsters. At each stage of this report, I have documented both the actionable steps as well as my reflections on these steps as a consequence to the project's successful outcome. **This report has text and images**.

This project documents the creation of the game '19-Fortuna' and my part, records, and reflections as project manager of the group. This document also serves as a submission for assignment 2 for Advanced Modelling and Animation (IS74023B) at Goldsmiths College, University of London. This  submission forms the individual write up component, presented in a development diary style, and records how the team was organised, key milestones and design decisions, assets, code, design material, and self-reflection on what worked well, what was less successful, what I may focus on next if I had more time, or what I would change if starting the whole process again.  

## 2. Team Organisation
The team for this project comprised 7 members - 4 from the MA Computer Games Art and Design programme, and 3 from the MA Independent Games Design programme. The organisational chart for this project is detailed below. Owing to the relatively larger team size, I was able to assign each team member a specific role and responsibility, based on that team member's forte and desire to specialise. As such, each member was responsbile for one primary / vital function of the project, but also served in a supporting role for the every other team member. From this organisation system, I was able to keep a rotating roster of responsibilities for every member, with a key area of focus assigned to each. The team comprised:
![alt_tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/cw2-images/roles.png)

1. **Project Leader**: Arjun Khara  
2. **Art Director**: Touraj Khosravi  
3. **Lead Programmer**: Thomas Tanugi  
4. **Modeller**: Daniel Nicholson  
5. **Animator**: Doruk Hasdogan  
6. **Environment Artist**: Ece Hasdogan  
7. **Sound Artist**: Billy Wichaya Karnchanapee  

However, given each member also has additional responsibilities, the flip side of the team's organisation includes the following arrangement for roles and support staff, which each team member was required to uphold. The following list details each team member's name and the assigned responsibilities:  

1. **Arjun Khara** (Project Leader; Game Researcher; Supporting Modeller; Programmer Bug Fixing)  
2. **Touraj Khosravi** (Art Director; Crystals Designer; Modelling Retopologist)  
3. **Thomas Tanugi** (Lead Programmer; Supporting Modeller; Bug Fixing Oversight)  
4. **Daniel Nicholson** (Modeller for Spaceship; Modeller for Crystals; Supporting Programmer and Bug Fixer)  
5. **Doruk Hasdogan** (Animator; Environment Artist Support; Unity General Support)  
6. **Ece Hasdogan** (Environment Artist; Modeller for Monsters; Supporting Modeller)  
7. **Billy Karnchanapee** (Sound Artist; Support Programmer; Unity Bug Fixing; GitHub Repository Management)  

Within this roles-based list, each member's responsibilities overlapped with other members to create a cohesive team that could lean on each other to accomplish set tasks. The game's requirements, though simple as per the assignment brief, nonetheless merited a more sound strategy, given the size of our team. Therefore, each team member was required to exercise their discretion over their selected area of responsibilities and provide additional support to the rest of the team. Because of the team's size and time of year (towards end of term) getting the entire group together was a challenge. Further work cycles and key milestone measurement representatives were also established to ensure that each task was being looked after and each dependency was being delivered on time.
![alt_tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/cw2-images/venn.png)

1. **Thomas Tanugi** — drone leaving the mech; face the mech and turn
2. **Billy Karnachanapee** — work on making the drill particles more believable
3. **Billy Karnachanapee** — Skyrim model movement of mech camera pan
4. **Billy Karnachanapee; Daniel Nicholson** — crystal breaks down
5. **Arjun Khara; Touraj Khosravi; Daniel Nicholson** — mech texture and materials
6. **Arjun Khara; Doruk Hasdogan** — monster attacking animation
7. **Ece Hasdogan** — monster variety
8. **Arjun Khara** — UI tutorial for players
9. **Doruk Hasdogan** — crystal prefabs
10. **Arjun Khara; Thomas Tanugi** — Youtube video demonstration
11. **Arjun Khara; Billy Karnachanapee** — total sound implementation
12. **Doruk Hasdogan** — replace drill animation

We therefore allocated three compulsory meet ups for all hands, followed by regular sessions where those who could meet in person did so, while the others dialed into the meeting via Skype. At all stages, the team was kept apprised of each other's activities since all members were, to a greater or lesser degree, involved in everyone else's work. We therefore adopted an agile dependencies model through which the team completed their tasks and marked off their milestones in parallel, rather than sequentially. This ensured that the team maximised the ample resources afforded to each, and that no one person was laden with singularly massive tasks.  

## 3. Key Milestones
The key milestones for this project consisted of the following six tasks:  
1. **Generate game concept**  
2. **Agree on roles and assign responsibilities**  
3. **Set up dependencies for tasks**  
4. **Establish first-run MVP and alpha testing**  
5. **Run bug-fixing and establish beta testing**  
6. **Revisit user-testing reports and demonstrate final version**

###### 1. Generate Game Concept
The game concept began as a series of sketches and discussions on what types of genre would best suit the third-person player game built in Unity. Given also the size of the group and to manage the expectations of each member, it was decided that a game set in the future would work best. The game concept that was settled was a non-duelling space mining game that challenged the talents of each of the group's members. We wanted a game that afforded ample opportunities for each member without over exceeding the assignment's mandate or taking on too many tasks that we would not be able to achieve in the limited time frame. Ultimately, it was decided that a search and self-rescue game that limited weapons and built in a low-poly style would best meet the challenges and rigours of the game. The concept was further refined to reflect a future setting (Year 2118) in which a mining robot would drill for crystals while avoiding rock monsters that inhabit the asteroid. Once the game's concept was finalised, the next key milestone could be established. The game concept key milestone was met on **February 23, 2018**.

###### 2. Roles and Responsibilities
With the game concept finalised, a definition of all the roles and responsibilities was drawn up. Each member then picked their roles based on their (i) interest and (ii) skills within that area of speciality. My role was project leader, assigned to oversee all aspects of the team and to guide the larger decisions of the project and manage the team towards its completion. Each member picked their roles and responsibilities which were agreed on by all the other team members. Because the team members already knew each other before the project commenced, there was an amicable and cordial relationship maintained throughout. Familiarity with each other's expertise was also instrumental in getting the team to co-operate intrinsically with each other. Competing interests were therefore kept to a minimum and each team member readily accepted their roles within the game and took their responsbilities seriously from the outset. The assigned roles and responsibilites milestone was completed on the **27 February 2018**.

###### 3. Dependencies for Tasks
Once the roles and responsibilities were finalised, a dependencies roster was established to provide all the team members with an overview of what the large milestone tasks of the game were. This dependencies roster (below) was vital in getting all members on the same page with respect to the overall timeline and goals. The dependencies roster was updated at intervals but the overall timeline remained the same. Some flexibility was built into the roster to ensure that individual members who faced scheduling or conflicting tasks were catered for. Setting up the dependencies roster took some time since I was responsible for working with each of the team's members to understand and accommodate their individual requirements for the game, expectations from themselves and from each other, and to balance the timeline with realistic goals and asset management. 

These meetings took place individually, as a one-to-one between myself as the project leader and each team member, since I needed to know at a discretionary level if any team mates had concerns about the performance and reliability of the other team members. Since I recruited each team member, it was my responsibility to ensure that all were happy and eager to work with the others and towards the final result. I also had to manage expectations on the grades that each team member wanted, and ensured that all of us were committed to creating an exceptional piece of work that went well beyond the standards required by the course and assignment. I am happy to reflect that each team member, without exception, expressed an intense desire to work at a distinction level, and not just settle for a pass. The dependencies milestone was completed on **5 March 2018**.

###### 4. First Run MVP and Alpha Testing
The first run MVP and alpha testing was settled for three weeks before the assignment due date, which was initially set for 10 April. Also, Thomas and I were both due to leave for internship and project research work at the end of the term, on 23 March 2018, and so we wanted to get the project completed by 20 March 2018. All of us agreed that the team would need to meet regularly, at least twice a week, for a build session that lasted at least 7 hours. This was accomplished with much success and the team met six times between the first milestone and the end of the project, and put in a total of 400 hours of work to get the game completed and to a high standard. Therefore, the first run MVP and alpha testing was ready ahead of schedule on **17 March 2018**.

###### 5. Bug-Fixing and Beta Testing
Running bug-fixing and beta testing was conducted immediately after the alpha testing phase was completed, and marked another milestone in our team's endeavours. The bug-fixing took a total of two days, with four of the seven team members with programming experience, working on the project. We knew that bug-fixing would be a time-consuming and necessary process, and that we would run out of time closer to the end date of the project. We therefore assigned a permanent bug-fixer from our group to test the game during design and development. Billy was assigned as bug fixer and his role, beyond sound recording, was to test the game and involve other students from different programmes to test the game and give their feedback. The game was therefore put through its paces during development, which proved a wise decision on reflection given the number of bugs we caught. The bug-fixing report and general beta deployment was prepared and made fully ready on **19 March 2018**.

###### 6. Further User-Testing and Demonstration
Towards the end of March 2018 the team had a fully-working prototype of the game that we demonstrated to our class and to Steve and Mike (our instructors). The game was well-received, with feedback going mainly to refining existing assets. Mike even praised the ingenuity of our game, and particularly paid praise to how the team had managed to simplify and drill down to the primary feedback loops that made the game work. Other feedback included refining drilling effects and navigation of the robot to make it look less stick-like. On the whole, however, the feedback was highly positive from both our instructors and our class mates, some of whom took to playing the game after our demonstration. 

I documented each piece of feedback from our instructors and class mates during these demonstration sessions, and ran them by the group in our meetings afterwards to assess whether the feedback was viable for inclusion or if it could be fixed at a later date, since some of the feedback involved tweaks that went far beyond the course requirements and time allocated. Beyond this date, we continued working on making existing assets stronger, and augmenting the overall distinct gameplay experience. In the end, the project was a success and marked a key milestone of MVP completion. The fully-working MVP was completed on **23 March 2018**.  

## 4. Design Decisions
19-Fortuna is based on a space-mining operation that takes place a hundred years from the present. Because of the game's nature, I opted to be the main researcher given my background with astronomy as a serious hobby and past minor study at degree level. The game was based on a real life asteroid, called 19-Fortuna — an asteroid orbiting in the belt between Mars and Jupiter — and therefore required some attention to the realities of what a mining operation on the asteroid might be like so that our design decisions were fully informed and guided. Discovered on 22 April 1852 by John Russell Hind, 19-Fortuna is a main-belt asteroid approximately 250 km in diameter. The size alone provided for ample level and environment design, which is why I researched asteroids within this size band. The size would provide an adequate limit for the team's environment modellers to visualise and design. 
![alt_tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/cw2-images/design-items.png)

With the space-mining theme in place, the group turned towards the actual gameplay mechanics that would drive the design. It was agreed that for a space mining operation to be feasible, the asteroid would need to have a certain class of minerals that would be of interest to scientists and terra-formers in the present. Once again, 19 Fortuna provided the perfect foil: the asteroid is rich in a mineral called tholin, which might yield potential chemical properties of interest to energy markets. Therefore, we decided that tholin would be the main material that the mining operation in 2118 would be concerned with. While in reality tholin exists as a granulated mineralised deposits, for the purposes of the game's design, we decided that the tholin deposits would be in the form of crystals, which would provide a more aesthetically pleasing and identifiable design for the game and its players. 
![alt_tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/cw2-images/Star-Field-Generation-19-Fortuna.jpg)

The crystals for the robot to mine were therefore designed to reflect the speculated properties of tholin — a lavender-turquoise hue with a hexagonal crystalline shard appearance. The environment design of the game was therefore framed by this research. Because crystalline structures usually exist in the presence of some liquid, we decided that the environment should also be designed with hydrocarbon lakes, which would add to the visual engagement of the game. Finally, given the lack of any atmosphere on 19 Fortuna, the game's sphere would be dark against a star field, with actual constellations and planets within the orbital view. Lighting for the levels were therefore determined to come from the crystals itself that would glow from within, and provide players with the necessary lighting to see the environment.
![alt_tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/cw2-images/19-Fortuna-robot-1.png)

With the environment design in place, the team turned to solve the problem of narrative. I conceived of a plot that involved a future corporation called the Mining Federation of Space-Based Entrepreneurs (MFSBE) which looks like the abbreviations of a listed company. The MFSBE is an unethical corporation that exploits its resources to maximise profit in an almost dystopian space-faring age. With the Earth in desperate need of extra-planetary resources — having depleted our own through over-consumption — the MFSBE has carved out a niche by providing tholin from asteroid mining operations, that drive specific industrial operations on Earth.

The MFSBE uses indentured miners — a race of tough humanoid creatures from Europa, enslaved and forced to work in dangerous conditions for virtually no pay. In the game, the miners have been wiped out on 19 Fortuna by rock monsters, natives of the asteroid, which were not detected by the MFSBE's research team, owing to typical cost-cutting measures. Rather than send in rescue missions, the MFSBE has turned to mining robot mechs to do the job. The mech therefore was modelled to emulate a biped drilling robot that harnesses the tholin crystals. However, each mech is controlled by a human being, and so while the conditions are marginally safer for the pilot in a mech, the dangers of being attacked by a rock monster remain high.
![alt_tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/cw2-images/19-Fortuna-Robot-2.png)

One of the primary considerations for the game was balancing reality and gameplay, which meant getting the gravity and collisions correct. Despite the mech being on an asteroid (which has micro-gravity) it was imperative for play that the mech walk and move about like it was on Earth, with a gravity of 9.8 m/s2. The same applied to the rock monsters, who would otherwise drift off into space. Yet the team also needed to communicate a subtle sense of microgravity and an alien world where the expectations of physics would be different. This difference was conveyed through the drill mechanism, shown in this concept image below. When the mech drills, the particles fly about and dissipiate into the environment, as though weightless, rather than settle to the ground in clumps as they would on Earth. Same went for the crystals when mined. The broken chunks float and pivot in space before vapourising into the background. These subtle nuances were of paramount importance in getting the theme of a forlorn robot in space through to the audience. Part of my responsibilities as creator of the overall narrative was to examine these issues and create concept mock ups for the team to refer to. A number of skills (soft and hard) came together with several concepts and iterations to create the final product. My role therefore expanded to include knowledge of not just 3D-modelling software like Maya, Blender, Mixamo, Quixel, ZBrush, and Mudbox, but also animation and artwork programmes such as Illustrator, Photoshop, and After Effects (used to create the drilling effect below). 
![alt_tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/cw2-images/mech-crystals.jpg)

Likewise, the script used in the game to facilitate dialog between the player and the orbiting space ship that rescues the mech in the last stage of the game (discussed below) shows the almost cavalier and uncaring attitude displayed by the MFSBE for its employees. This tone sets the expectations of the game and its players — the mech and its pilot (the player) are alone doing the bidding of a shady and highly profitable corporation for rank pay. The desperate and degrading situation of the earth and its inhabitants is therefore reflected in the vast openess and in some cases helplessness of space, in which the wonders of discovering life on other worlds is eclipsed by the dangers of getting killed by these creatures. This backstory point is a major driver of the game's play design and is critical in setting up the expectations of the player — alien creatures remain hostile to the grasping and greedy hands of earth-based corporations.
![alt_tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/cw2-images/Initial-Voiceover-Script-19-Fortuna.png)

This is the driving design factor of the game — the player is armed with a mech without any weapons (more space for more crystals) and is therefore required to use his or her wits to outsmart the rock monsters who thankfully are not as intelligent as human beings. This narrative informed the design of the game and the mech — a drilling robot who's task is to drill crystals and avoid rock monsters by either running away or by hacking its reconnaissance camera to shoot an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) if it harvests sufficient crystals. The player is therefore challenged with a threat situation against an enemy but without the use of conventional weapons. This design decision places the game apart from typical third person shooters in which the protagonist(s) engages with enemies with weapons. In 19-Fortuna, the game requires players to use movement mechanics as they defensive measures. As an added twist, the asteroid has become unstable with all the mining operations — accounted and unaccounted — taking place. In the game, the asteroid begins to break apart in the last stage, and the player has to race the mech back to the extraction point or risk being marooned and lost to the fiery ends of the doomed asteroid.
![alt_tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/cw2-images/19-Fortuna-Robot-3.png)

The primary design decisions are therefore informed by real-world research and narratives which players do no necessarily encounter but nonetheless experience through the game. Given the relative complexity of the game's narrative, it was decided that a low-poly design would best meet the resource requirements of the game. A low-poly design would also work in favour of visual aesthetics, given the beauty of the space-like scene in which the game takes place. Each sub-design decision was therefore taken on the premise of these primary design considerations. It is fortunate that the team decided to base the game's design on real-world scenarios and with well-developed back stories because these provided a robust framework in which we could build and concieve the game and its mechanics.

In this scene, the mech is in its drill pose and is drilling tholin crystals — light bluish-green minerals that emanate a glow from within. These crystals, other than being the game’s primary resource objective, also serve as waypoints for the mech to navigate its way through the levels. The mech has been skinned in a translucent metal, indicative of spacesuits worn by modern-day astronauts as well as the shells of the International Space Station (ISS). The space-age material looks futuristic but remains identifiable as an Earth-originating metal. 

The skin of the mechanised robot contrasts with the alien surroundings to make it stand out and feel more alone and unique. A rock monster  is standing sentry, another key design decision to ensure the feelings of danger and threats. The mech however is putting on a show of force and defiance as it drills close to the rock monster and slowly colonises its world. This fearless, glowing robot is replete with the best engineering but is coerced to maintain silence and a low profile as it makes it way into the interior of the asteroid. The glory of Earth is therefore juxtaposed against a tiny rock which could contain the minerals for Earth's survival. All of these scenes and designs are necessary to ensure a more solitary yet hopeful feel for the player. 

This loneliness is augmented by a pale purple mist that envelopes the asteroid, a result of researching 19-Fortuna and other space rocks, which do not possess an atmosphere owing to low gravity but contain gaseous pockets that often erupt violently when the face of the asteroid comes into contact with sunlight, causing this mist to appear. These gases, help to hide the mech’s locations from the prowling  rock monsters. Therefore the gas, though mysterious and perhaps a source of danger to the player is also a sheltering blanket that the player will quickly realise is essential for survival in the game. 

At the base of the glowing crystals — and in fact across the entire environment — there are crystal fragments, which represent past human expeditions to the asteroid. This seemingly minor detail is critical to conveying the game's current theme and narrative, since the game begins in the middle of a chaotic shift of power. The fragments tell of the past stories that led to this reality and are therefore markers of the game's narrative and a factor for the player to consider when exploring this so-called new world which has in fact been visited several times in the past. The design considerations have been put in place to entice the player to explore the game’s hostile environment while also realising that not everything is as it appears and that realities are often forged through perceptions as much as actions. At this more profound level, the design considerations affect the game's associations with current-day realities and problems, which is brought to light through the nuances and connotations of a larger narrative concept.

On reflection, I am grateful for these design inclusions — major and minor — because basing a game on actual research keeps the project focused and the team on track to working towards something real and easily visualised. The design of the game and its accompanying decisions are therefore based on this research and the accompanying narrative that is fictional in nature but nonetheless a viable future that is easily imagined. And if the design is easily imagined, it is easier to convince players of the game's experience.

## 5. Design Material and Assets
The following collage captures the essence of the game and its component parts. Each of the material assets and design considerations are explained below. The team constantly referred to both this collage, which also represented a mood board for the game that evolved throughout the process, as well as the technical specifications table (please see section 6) which details the software and tools used to create and manage our assets.
![alt_tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/cw2-images/collage.png)

###### Branding and Identity
The name 19-Fortuna provided a fortuitous opportunity: the title bears clear overtones to the ‘soldier of fortune’ theme, which is largely what the pilot of the mech ascribes to. There is literally a fortune to be made in the mining of tholin crystals, and the name has the perfect tone and structure. The typeface is MinstrelPoster WHG, which conveys specific visual sets within its basic construct to evoke a more nostalgic feel, referencing perhaps games as well as cinema in the 1970s and 1980s. The direct curves and non-tapered joins offer a clear and rigid poster form, characteristic of a no-nonsense heroism, which ties in well with the game. Given also that the game is low-poly, the typeface’s simplicity in form, parity, and weight accompany the mood and perfectly balances with the tone of the game.
![alt_tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/cw2-images/logo19-fortuna.png)

###### Mech Drilling Robot
The mechanised robot (mech) is the main character in the third-person game, which is essential to brand and identity recognition. The mech has therefore been designed as a unique shape and form, with deliberately bulbous shoulders and sculpted thighs. The small head on the mech has been designed to summon a more machine-based, and less thinking-driven drone, to give the player a sense of superiority. Because the game has a low-poly look and feel, all elements have been given a blocky, unfinished feel. This appearance is a brand differentiator and will be applied across all elements from characters to environment.

###### Crystals
At the base of the glowing tholin crystals are tiny fragments of the mineral, left over by earlier miners and operations. Since the narrative of the game involves confirmation of the viability of tholin crystals, theses fragments are proof of these early visitations and accompanying missions to test the asteroid. In other words the fragments are symbolic of past human visits to the asteroid during our civilisation’s glory days of conquest and space exploration. Overall, the concept art demonstrates the branded and gameplay items used to create the game, 19-Fortuna. The main purpose is to entice players to explore the game’s potential, and to readily pick up the packaging for further investigation and purchase. At a deeper level, the concept art targets the connotations of the game and brings to light the subtle nuances and associations of the game to the larger narrative concept.

###### Sky Sphere Environment
The game takes place in space, at the outset of an imminent collapse of civilisation on Earth. The idea of interplanetary exploration is evident in the game’s environment and a broad emphasis is placed on the theme of ‘home away from home’. The rescue of Earth and its inhabitants is contingent on the mech finding a cure to the problem of scarcity of land very much ironically in the dark, hostile recesses of outer space. The setting is a stark allusion to the progress of humankind — the asteroid belt lies beyond Mars which is currently humankind’s next boundary — as well as the reduction of its potential, mere missions to tiny rocks that may hold the key to our survival. The space exploration sub-genre is contained within the narrative themes of the game which reinforce immersion and player engagement.

###### Storyline + Low-Poly Aesthetic
19-Fortuna is space-faring exploration game, framed under the sub-genre of third-person action and adventure. The narrative of the game follows the adventures of a mechanised robot and its pilot in the year 2118. The populations on Earth, devastated by rising sea levels, are facing almost total collapse. The inundation of large cities and towns means land scarcity is at an all time high. Space-based agencies have deployed mass operations to seek more hospitable zones on nearby planets, but these missions have proven fruitless thus far. However, through pure luck, one of these operations has discovered that tholin crystals, when in contact with water, rapidly grow and expand to several factors of their original size. 

A fairly novel solution has been proposed by world governments to mine this tholin and plant the crystals within Earth’s oceans and seas to literally regrow new land, rather than move the planet’s people and bio-sphere to space. Initial tests have indicated success and the world has put aside its armies to create the Global Asteroid Initiatives Alliance (GAIA) to oversee all asteroid mining operations. Probes have been launched and 19-Fortuna has proven to be Earth’s best bet to mine tholin and save humanity from catastrophe.

The low-poly aesthetic sets a specific visual trend for the game and allows players to immerse themselves in an atypical scene which nonetheless delivers all of the characteristics of a third-person gameplay. Additionally, the low poly aesthetic saves on graphics resources, offering a more enjoyable experience in a far less computer-intensive environment. The aesthetic style also extends to gameplay on HD and UHD screens, which adds further pixelation and anti-aliasing along the edges of game objects, which adds to the form factor appeal.

###### Sounds and Script 
The sound and script for the game is a high-beat mix tempo, involving triumphal overtones that mix with deliberate minor riffs that offer counterpoints to the overall heroism of the soundtrack. More akin to the John Williams and Hans Zimmer tunes for Star Wars and Interstellar, respectively the soundtrack will nonetheless be restrained in its orchestral qualities, given the low-poly ergo more frivolous ambience. The score will therefore comprise sufficient volumes of peaks and lows but confined within a light overtone that also captures the simplicity and milder severity of 19-Fortuna: Bb Major with C Minor.

###### Mechanics
The game mechanics involve moving the mech, looking around, walking, drilling, strafing, drone-launches, and detonating an EMP. These mechanics extend to animating the rock monsters, to provide some congruency between game elements. Mechanics have also taken into account low gravity conditions on asteroids, and have led to the creation of weight-based elements, namely the jet thrusters that weigh down the mech so that it walks like it is on Earth. The monsters, however, are able to maintain their gravities though in some cases, the game mechanics allow for the monsters to slip and slide in microgravity.

## 6. Technical Considerations
The table below comprises the entire set of softwares, assets, and design details required to create the game, along with the tools and systems used to construct and manage the game. These assets have been broadly categorised into overarching groups for easier reference among the team members. Each team member was required to use the assets given in the table to ensure consistency of devices, operating systems, and version control.

## 7. Self-Reflection
Heading a project of this team size and scale for the first time elicits its own sense of achievements, failures, and learnings. I have thus separated these learnings and practices into seven reflections: learnings from game narratives; managing large talent pools; keeping checks and balances; saying no to good and bad ideas; compartmentalising team efforts; ending and making hard decisions; managing teams and time for future implementation.
![alt_tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/cw2-images/19team.jpg)

###### Keeping True to Real-World Narrative Expectations
In any science fiction adventure set in the future, the realities of the narratives are anchored in the histories of the cultural past. Likewise, key game elements such as story, setting, plot, narratives, and characterisation of players are constructed for rapid association and recognition with current-day audiences. In other words, the game is built for the present audience. Journeys of interplanetary space travel possess a phantasmagorical quality, prevalent in current-day games and define the cultural context of 19-Fortuna. As a space-based game set a hundred years in the future, 19-Fortuna embodies a collection of science fiction sources,reminescent of a variety of video games and television shows, ranging from Battlefield 2142 and Eve Online to Star Trek and Babylon 5. 

Each offer insights into 19-Fortuna’s cultural influences — first as a space rescue operation; second as a technology-based civilisation beyond Earth. The biblical, cultural and historical influences are thus manifest in both, the sub-genres of science fiction in space, as well as allegory and parable storytelling narratives that reinforce the need for civilisations to extend their boundaries beyond human and divine limits. Understanding the pretext and context of the game allowed me to create and manage a narrative that was as true to real-life expectations as possible.

###### Managing Large Pools of Talent
My team was the largest of all the groups (comprising 7 members in total). Each member brought a unique set of talents and expectations to the project. I quickly learned that my responsibilities as project leader was not just managing the game and its real-world expectations, but in allocating each member the best possible task that matched his or her abilities and desires. Matching each team member to his or her role was not an easy task, since individual talents overlapped, as is often the case in large teams. Therefore managing disappointment and saying no was a key process for the team's success and my personal development as the project leader. It was also imperative that each member realised the team was only as strong as the weakest member, and so each member had to be organised to shore up weaknesses in other members along the way, myself included. 

###### Keeping Checks and Balances
I initiated a systems of checks and balances that covered every team member's task to ensure support systems existed at every step. This proved more challenging than I previously expected since the very idea of building in support systems carries latent redundancies in task management, which I also had to grapple with. Fortunately, the allocation of tasks to each team member proved successful and a happy team is indeed a productive team. Each member was able to pick up the slack of the others and the project carried along its timeline and was completed a few days ahead of schedule. I learned that it is crucial to pick a carefully managed team, assign responsibilities, then step back and let each member perform at his or her best. Micro-managing does not work, especially for a team of talented artists who look for leadership as a cohesive, overarching framework, rather than a dominant force of authority. As such my role as project manager was to make clear the expectations of each member, and only step in for arbitration during disputes.

###### Saying No to Good + Bad Ideas
Given the size of the team, I was faced with picking from a barrage of good ideas. Each member, especially at the beginning of the project, possessed his or her own ideas of what and how the game should be. While many hands make light work, it is also true that too many cooks spoil the broth. As a project manager, I was responsible for saying no to ideas but not to reject the people who came up with them. This required tact and patience on my part, which I got better at as the project progressed. Saying no is a vital skill and people learn to respect the strength it takes for a leader to oppose a good idea for the greater good of the project and its vision. 

Building a team requires that every member buys into the idea of a cohesive unit, where the group is stronger than the sum of its parts. This is easier said than done, since egos, pride, and feelings often get in the way. Furthermore, the project's core is creativity and with subjectivity at a high priority, dealing with artists required more than just words. To solve this issue I asked each member to back up their suggestions and ideas with real mood boards, concept art, and implementation plans. If these proved to be worthwhile, the idea was adopted. In this way, team members themselves began to see the benefits and burdens between suggestions and actions. This was a vital learning for team management, and a lesson I intend to carry through to every job.

###### Compartmentalising Efforts
Managing a large team also meant breaking the team into smaller units for easier control and co-ordination. Fortunately, each of my team mates was highly amicable to the others, and once a hierarchy of responsibilities was democratically established, each member understood the value of the hierarchy in maintaining the team's sights on the larger goal of building the game, rather than on individual visions. As the project progressed, I am pleased to say the team cohesed into a focused unit, working up to 10 hours a day on the project to finish their part of the work. Nothing succeeds like success and once the project began to take shape, each team member was inspired by the result and pushed for ever greater standards of excellence. I am happy to report that a strong start to team management is vital to its progress and conclusion, and from this perspective, this was a successful project at every stage.

###### Ending + Making Hard Decisions
When does a project end? Towards the final stages of the project, each team member wanted to give a little more to the game, having been inspired by its progress. While this was a happy issue, it is imperative that a project end on time since improvements are countless and everything at the final stage is both a possibility to improve the game or a problem to push it beyond the prescribed limits. Time was of the essence, and I learned that as a project manager I am not just responsible for the team's performance, but also for time. It became a naturalised assumption that I, as the project leader, would tell the team when to stop. Therefore each member continued to build their part of the game without much regard for time management. 

###### Managing Teams + Time
As a result, the project was dangerously overloaded with inputs that every member had worked hard on but had not fully accounted for time, when balanced with the inputs of other members. I daresay that project management equates to time management, and so I had to put a hard stop to the team's work towards the final stages. This abrupt end caused the game to lose out on some potentially beneficial features but I had to make a call on when the game was ready, and not perfect. This is something I would change in the future: time management is not a feature that is called upon at the end, but at the beginning and throughout the project at each stage. Likewise, time management is not in the purview of the team leader but a responsibility for every team member to adopt and control. If I had to do this project again, this is what I would change; I would want to make it clear to every team member that time management is everyone's shared and equal responsibility.

## 8. Conclusion
The fantasy science fiction sub-genre communicates via the obvious missions to space, with a mechanised robot capable of advanced functions like drilling and also semi-autonomous motion — moving, evading, strafing, and running when required to. But, fantasy is also firmly acknowledged in the somewhat heretical encounters with a group of aliens who ironically are simple, backward, and unevolved and yet are able to pose a major threat to a so-called advanced civilisation like Earth. This ironic situation is augmented by the twist in power relations — typically it is Earth that is cast as being the backward civilisation in alien warfare but nonetheless wins against the advanced beings. In 19-Fortuna the roles are reversed though the outcome of the plain underdog winning may still be preserved. This threat of affairs is made apparent through the game's design, concept, and art and animation. 

The demo video of the game, available on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcXcz6zjZb0&feature=youtu.be) has been filmed from Unity, and some effects have been augmented in video post-processing software. This is to present a proper demo video of gameplay, that might be used to showcase to clients and future employers of the potential ideas and skills that I may offer them.

19-Fortuna is therefore an aggrandisement of the works of  designers, decision-makers, and project specialists who fused to form a well-established team. On balance I am happy to report that my team did an excellent job. I was fortunate to gather a group of talented and caring individuals who were more concerned with producing a great result, rather than promote any individual itinerary. The team also realised that the team leader often gets the credit for a successful project, and were happy to let that be. 

I made it clear to each member that a project and its manager is only as good as the team on which it is built. I believe that tolerance, cohesion, and an element of luck are all important in equal doses if one is to captialise on the success of a team to build something worth playing. I would characterise this project a success not just because the game we built works well and looks great, but also because each team member is now a friend here at the project's end.
