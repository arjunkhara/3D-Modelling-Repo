This project documents the creation of the game '19-Fortuna' and my part, records, and reflections as project manager of the group. This document also serves as a submission for assignment 2 for Advanced Modelling and Animation (IS74023B) at Goldsmiths College, University of London. This  submission forms the individual write up component, presented in a development diary style, and records how the team was organised, key milestones and design decisions, assets, code, design material, and self-reflection on what worked well, what was less successful, what I may focus on next if I had more time, or what I would change if starting the whole process again.

## 1. Introduction
19-Fortuna is a third-person game built in Unity by a group of seven members. The game centers around the narrative of a mech robot that mines for tholin crystals on the eponymous asteroid, (i.e 19 Fortuna). The asteroid, rich in tholin — a highly commodofied material on Earth — is also teeming with rock monsters who pose a problem for the mining mech. The mission is to drill as many tholin crystals as possible while avoiding the rock monsters. Armed with only a drill, and an electromagnetic pulse that generates when the mech appropriates a tholin crystal for use, the main strategy of the game is drill for minerals and avoid being attacked through motion mechanics in the game — strafing, dodging, and keeping out of proximity from the rock monsters. ![alt_tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/cw2-images/19-Fortuna.jpg)

## 2. Team Organisation
The team for this project comprised 7 members - 4 from the MA Computer Games Art and Design programme, and 3 from the MA Independent Games Design programme. The organisational chart for this project is detailed below. Owing to the relatively larger team size, I was able to assign each team member a specific role and responsibility, based on that team member's forte and desire to specialise. As such, each member was responsbile for one primary / vital function of the project, but also served in a supporting role for the every other team member. From this organisation system, I was able to keep a rotating roster of responsibilities for every member, with a key area of focus assigned to each. The team comprised of:
1. Project Leader: Arjun Khara  
2. Art Director: Touraj Khosravi  
3. Lead Programmer: Thomas Tanugi  
4. Modeller: Daniel Nicholson  
5. Animator: Doruk Hasdogan  
6. Environment Artist: Ece Hasdogan  
7. Sound Artist: Billy Wichaya Karnchanapee  

However, given each member also has additional responsibilities, the flip side of the team's organisation includes the following arrangement for roles and support staff, which each team member was required to uphold. The following list details each team member's name and the assigned responsibilities:  
• Arjun Khara (Project Leader; Character Movement; Supporting Modeller; Programmer Bug Fixing)<br/>• Touraj Khosravi (Art Director; Crystals Designer; Modelling Retopologist)<br/>• Thomas Tanugi (Lead Programmer; Supporting Modeller; Bug Fixing Oversight)<br/>• Daniel Nicholson (Modeller for Spaceship; Modeller for Crystals; Supporting Programmer and Bug Fixer)<br/>• Doruk Hasdogan (Animator; Environment Artist Support; Unity General Support)<br/>• Ece Hasdogan (Environment Artist; Modeller for Monsters; Supporting Modeller)<br/>• Billy Karnchanapee (Sound Artist; Support Programmer; Unity Bug Fixing; GitHub Repository Management).

Within this roles-based list, each member's responsibilities overlapped with other members to create a cohesive team that could lean on each other to accomplish set tasks. The game's requirements, though simple as per the assignment brief, nonetheless merited a more sound strategy, given the size of our team. Therefore, each team member was required to exercise their discretion over their selected area of responsibilities and provide additional support to the rest of the team. Because of the team's size and time of year (towards end of term) getting the entire group together was a challenge. We therefore allocated three compulsory meet ups for all hands, followed by regular sessions where those who could meet in person did so, while the others dialed into the meeting via Skype. At all stages, the team was kept apprised of each other's activities since all members were, to a greater or lesser degree, involved in everyone else's work. We therefore adopted an agile dependencies model through which the team completed their tasks and marked off their milestones in parallel, rather than sequentially. This ensured that the team maximised the ample resources afforded to each, and that no one person was laden with singularly massive tasks.
