# Sculpting, Modelling and Animating Progress (2018)

This is my repository to track my progress in Advanced Modelling and Animation module at Goldsmiths College, University of London (2018). This documentation is for learning ZBrush and using it to create a 3D character. This documentation is specifically done for the Advanced Modelling and Animation module at Goldsmiths College, University of London (2017-2018) course. I am starting out this course with zero knowledge of ZBrush. My aim is to learn ZBrush well enough to create 3D characters, and to document these learnings for future students of this course. 

After installing ZBrush, open the programme. Click on the LightBox option, at the top left, to get rid of the pop-up menu that opens. I am beginning by learning how to create and sculpt a sphere as the starting point to learn the layout of ZBrush. Click on the golden S-shaped icon in the right panel. This will open the sculpting options. Click on the Sphere icon in the right panel. Also click on Make PolyMesh3D from the panel. Then click on the Edit button on the top panel (highlighted in yellow). Drag out a sphere onto the canvas. To zoom in, press CTRL + ALT and hold down the RMB. To rotate, simply drag the mouse around the canvas. To pan up, down, left and right, press ALT and hold down the RMB. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide1.PNG "First Attempt at ZBrush")

ZBrush has a host of brushes for use. Click on the Standard icon on the top-left, to access all of the brush options. Each of these brushes can be assigned a hotkey by hovering the cursor over the brush type, then pressing ALT and CTRL together. A pop-up dialog box will ask the user to enter a hotkey combination. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide2.PNG "Exploring the brushes")

To sculpt, simply drag the mouse or tablet pen over the mesh. This action begins warping the geometry according to the pen action. The default action raises or pulls out the mesh. To push in the mesh, hold down alt. In the image, the top section shows the mesh being pulled out, whereas the bottom section shows the mesh being pushed in. Holding down SHIFT will even out the mesh. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide3.PNG "First attempt at sculpting")

The mesh geometry can be sub-divided by clicking on the Divide option in the right panel. This allows the user to work on individual segments of the model. In this example, I have used one brush and a combination of pulls and pushes to give the sphere a roughened look. The potential to sculpt almost anything, from planets to alien creatures is virtually limitless. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide4.PNG "Geometry exploration")

The sculpting brush size can be adjusted using the brush size slider, located on the top horizontal bar. It can also be adjusted by hitting the space bar to bring up the menu. Both brush size and intensity can be adjusted in these ways, and both variables are important. In this example I have increased the size of the brush and, holding down ALT, I have created a crater along the pole of this sphere. Then I reduced the brush size and created a series of ridges along the edge of the crater to provide the feeling of an impact. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide5.PNG "Crater Project")

In this example I have made further refinements to the crater. By using a combination of brush size and intensity, and varying the numbers for each, | have managed to create a series of detailed ridges along the impact crater. This method can be applied to creating fine detail for characters, such as veins in muscles or worm-like textures in soil. To save any work, simply click on the Save As option in the right panel. The usual dialog box will open. Enter the name of the file and click save. Note: do not click Save As Document, from the options under Document in the top menu. This will only save the 2D maps and not the editable 3D file. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide6.PNG "Crater Project")

By zooming in and out of the model, and using the same brush tools with varying intensity and size, I have managed to create additional detail to the impact site of the crater. There are smaller craters from spreading debris, and a variety of ridges and troughs along the edge, spilling outwards onto the rest of the planet. While very much a rudimentary design, this example illustrates the power of ZBrush to create complex shapes from simple tools. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide7.PNG "Crater Project")

In this example I will be learning to create the bash mesh for my eventual alien character. Click on the golden Brush icon in the right panel, and from the option pop-up that opens, choose ZSphere. I will be using multiple ZSpheres to create the torso of the character, which is fairly simple to do in ZBrush. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide8.PNG "ZSphere")

To create this torso shape, first create the ZSphere. Then create another one by dragging over the first ZSphere. Repeat this process two to three times. Once the torso is in place, it is time to create the shoulders. Press X to bring up the mirror option. This will create an identical ZSphere across from where the original ZSphere is drawn. Drag out a smaller ZSphere. The mirror option will automatically create an identical ZSphere on the other side. These will be the shoulder joints. From the menu above, click on Move and drag out either of the shoulders to create the t-shape as shown in the image. Next click on Scale and drag across the bottom sphere to reduce the size. The overall result will resemble the torso in the image. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide9.PNG "Torso creation")

Drag out another ZSphere on the top of the torso for the neck. Rotate the canvas and ensure the torso is lined up properly, i.e. stacked vertically and neatly above each other. If the alignment of the torso is off, use the Move tool (top menu, next to the Edit button) to move the spheres individually into place. This may take some getting used to but the process is easy to master after a few attempts. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide10.PNG "Torso shoulders creation")

To create the head, simply drag out another ZSphere from the neck and scale it accordingly. For the arms, first click on the shoulder joints and drag out while pressing SHIFT to ensure the arms snap to the shoulder. Once that is done, let go of SHIFT and press CTRL to extend the arms out to the desired length. The mirror option will automatically do the same thing on the other side of the torso to ensure symmetry. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide11.PNG "Torso arms creation")

I have moved the arms and scaled the shoulders accordingly to give the character a larger and more imposing form since that is the character type I am learning to build. By scaling and moving the individual components of the model, I am able to adjust the weight and heft of the base mesh. Use the hotkeys, Q (draw), W (move), E (scale), and R (rotate) to cycle through the options quickly. These hotkeys are identical to the hotkeys for the same commands in Maya. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide12.PNG "Torso arms refinement")

Using the same principles of snapping (hold down SHIFT and drag) and extensions (hold down CTRL and drag) I have created additional ZSpheres for the lower arms of the model. Remember to keep rotating around the figure to ensure the alignment of the torso remains consistent and upright. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide13.PNG "Torso arms refinement")

I have created the hands by drawing an additional ZSphere, then created the thumb and three fingers by drawing smaller ZSpheres onto the hand. Because the mirror option is selected, the hand and fingers on the other side of the model are also created. This is an important step for both symmetry and speed of sculpting. In the next steps I will be working on articulating the fingers. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide14.PNG "Torso fingers creation")

Here is the basic form of the alien character I will eventually create, with its four fingers protruding from the hand area. At this point the fingers look stiff and not mobile. I will fix this in the next step by giving the fingers articulation and positioning them to resemble a humanoid anatomy. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide15.PNG "Torso fingers creation")

The fingers now have a much more realistic humanoid feel, despite being only four digits. I created additional ZSpheres along where the articulation joints in the middle of the digits should be. Then I moved these joints individually into place till the result was satisfactory. I also moved the hand joints from where the digits protrude, and scaled down the fingers, while scaling up the thumb for greater visual contrast. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide16.PNG "Torso fingers articulation")

I have created the hips, hip joints, and extended these joints out using the SHIFT snapping and CTRL extension options to create the alienâ€™s thighs and legs. Since this creature will be a humanoid-type alien, the basic human anatomy has to be preserved but with a few fundamental alterations to the overall form. I have therefore given the alien spindly legs, and moved out the back and hip muscles to provide a weightier feel along the waist, rather than the legs which do not hold most of the weight for this species. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide17.PNG "Torso hips and legs")

Hitting the A key will bring up the model view of the mesh, like the sphere example in the previous section. The model view provides a clay-sculpt perspective to assess the overall shape of the creature. Hitting the A key again will return to the ZSphere view. It is a good idea to toggle between these views often to gain an overall perspective of how the model is shaping up. In the next step I will be creating the feet for the alien humanoid. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide18.PNG "Torso perspective")

I have created the basic foot by adding a ZSphere to the base of the leg then extending it out using the SHIFT and CTRL process I have been practicing with so far. I want this alien to have somewhat warped but still recognisable feet, which flow with the heft of the top torso. With the basic foot in place, the next step is to create the toes. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide19.PNG "Torso legs perspective")

I have created the toes and altered the foot shape for the alien. Like the fingers, each foot only has four toes. The inner toes are significantly larger than the rest, and the outer toe articulates in towards the rest of the toes. This anatomy gives the impression of a primate-like species that probably inhabits a tree-like world not that dissimilar to the Earth. It is important, while modelling, to realise the narrative of the piece for which the character is being created; this helps to keep the form and function of the character in check, not only to fit into the world it is destined for, but also to perform its animations in the intended manner. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide20.PNG "Torso toes")

Here is the alien humanoid character in the model-sculpt view. At this stage it is getting easier to see the characterâ€™s ultimate form and direction in which the modelling will take place. The overall shape is still human-like but the heavier top torso, coupled with the arms, four fingers, and relatively spindly legs offer the illusion that this being is not entirely human. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide21.PNG "Torso complete")

With the model now complete and ready for sculpting, it is time to turn the model into what Zbrush calls an Adaptive Skin. This process is straightforward: click on the Adaptive Skin option from the right panel. In the density option, choose 2, then click Make Adaptive Skin. ZBrush creates an icon for the adaptive skin in the tools panel above, top right. Click on the icon that has been created. At this point the ZSpheres can no longer be accessed and pressing A will not do anything. From here on, all modelling and sculpting will take place on this new adaptive skin. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide22.PNG "Adaptive skin")

In this section I am using the Move brush (not to be confused with the Move tool) to move the geometry mesh. The Move brush moves the mesh around to create shapes. I have used the move brush to give the figure more heft by sculpting muscles around the arms, and bringing in the clavicle to create a more pronounced form. I have also refined the shoulder muscles and chest area to provide added girth to the figure. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide23.PNG "Move brush")

Further refinements have been made to the calves, chest, and most prominently the head, which will immediately identify the character as an alien. The Move brush tool has a mirror option, which can be toggled using the X key so that all refinements made to one side of the mesh are automatically updated to the corresponding alternates. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide24.PNG "Sculpting chest and shoulders")

It is important to zoom into individual parts of the mesh to adjust each section. In this step I am focusing on making the fingers more wrinkled and articulated, with mild depressions representing where finger nails would have grown. Similarly, the knuckles need to be protruded and adjusted accordingly so that the humanoid look is preserved, but not so much that the hand is mistaken for entirely that of a humanâ€™s. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide25.PNG "Sculpting fingers")

Still using the Move brush tool, I have given the figure a stomach line that dips in just below the wide chest. The figureâ€™s chest muscles protrude far more than that of a human beingâ€™s but not so much as to break the line of belief. Likewise, the musculature along the figureâ€™s front, back and side has been modelled by referring to images of the human anatomy, then varied for alien-like differences. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide26.PNG "Sculpting stomach")

At times work will need to be carried out on specific parts of the model and not others, that will nonetheless get influenced during refinements. In such cases, the Mask tool is extremely handy. Hold down CTRL and drag across the figure, covering any part which should not interact with the brush. The area covering the figure will darken, indicating a protective mask has been applied. Sculpting can now take place in the lighter areas, which will have no affect on the darker, masked areas. Using the mask tool, I was able to articulate the calves independently of the upper thighs since that area is protected (uneditable). ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide27.PNG "Mask Tool")

It is also possible to invert the mask to cover the parts previously unprotected, by holding down CTRL and clicking the mouse, or tapping the pen. The mask will invert across the figure accordingly. To remove the mask, hold down CTRL and long tap with the pen on the tablet. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide28.PNG "Mask Tool")

Holding CTRL and SHIFT and dragging over the mesh isolates that section of the mesh, which is useful when a particular part of the model needs concentrated attention. In this example I have isolated the back of the alien to create this face-like form onto the skin, which blends into the spine and musculature of the alien. Once the isolated part of the modelling work is completed, hold CTRL and SHIFT and tap or drag in an empty space on the canvas, away from the model. Holding CTRL and SHIFT and ALT will isolate specific sections of the mesh. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide29.PNG "Isolation Tool")

When viewing the model in polyframe mode, it may be apparent that in some areas the model is lacking sufficient polygons to create volume. In this case, Dynamesh is critical. Dynamesh is a tool built into ZBrush that evens out the number of polygons, increasing the count where necessary, to provide smoother topology. Turn on Dynamesh under the geometry tab in the right panel, then go over the model using the same Move brush. Dynamesh will fill in the polygon count wherever changes to the model are made. To commit the Dynamesh changes, hold down CTRL and drag over an empty part of the canvas. In the example I have further refined the torso and arms of the alien, and created an Anubis-like jackal head. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide30.PNG "Head Sculpting with DynaMesh")

With the basic torso and body in place, it is time to sculpt in the actual musculature, or the ecorche, that is the human body without the skin. It is useful to have a reference image of the ecorche when sculpting the musculature. I have used the clay build-up brush here and by varying the brush size, I have sculpted out the muscle lines and cavities along the face. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide31.PNG "Muscle Sculpting")
