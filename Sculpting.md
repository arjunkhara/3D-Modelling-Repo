# Sculpting, Modelling and Animating Progress (2018)

This is my repository to track my progress in Advanced Modelling and Animation module at Goldsmiths College, University of London (2018). This documentation is for learning ZBrush and using it to create a 3D character. This documentation is specifically done for the Advanced Modelling and Animation module at Goldsmiths College, University of London (2017-2018) course. I am starting out this course with zero knowledge of ZBrush. My aim is to learn ZBrush well enough to create 3D characters, and to document these learnings for future students of this course. 

After installing ZBrush, open the programme. Click on the LightBox option, at the top left, to get rid of the pop-up menu that opens. I am beginning by learning how to create and sculpt a sphere as the starting point to learn the layout of ZBrush. Click on the golden S-shaped icon in the right panel. This will open the sculpting options. Click on the Sphere icon in the right panel. Also click on Make PolyMesh3D from the panel. Then click on the Edit button on the top panel (highlighted in yellow). Drag out a sphere onto the canvas. To zoom in, press CTRL + ALT and hold down the RMB. To rotate, simply drag the mouse around the canvas. To pan up, down, left and right, press ALT and hold down the RMB. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide1.PNG "First Attempt at ZBrush")

ZBrush has a host of brushes for use. Click on the Standard icon on the top-left, to access all of the brush options. Each of these brushes can be assigned a hotkey by hovering the cursor over the brush type, then pressing ALT and CTRL together. A pop-up dialog box will ask the user to enter a hotkey combination. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide2.PNG "Exploring the brushes")

To sculpt, simply drag the mouse or tablet pen over the mesh. This action begins warping the geometry according to the pen action. The default action raises or pulls out the mesh. To push in the mesh, hold down alt. In the image, the top section shows the mesh being pulled out, whereas the bottom section shows the mesh being pushed in. Holding down SHIFT will even out the mesh. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide3.PNG "First attempt at sculpting")

The mesh geometry can be sub-divided by clicking on the Divide option in the right panel. This allows the user to work on individual segments of the model. In this example, I have used one brush and a combination of pulls and pushes to give the sphere a roughened look. The potential to sculpt almost anything, from planets to alien creatures is virtually limitless. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide4.PNG "Geometry exploration")

The sculpting brush size can be adjusted using the brush size slider, located on the top horizontal bar. It can also be adjusted by hitting the space bar to bring up the menu. Both brush size and intensity can be adjusted in these ways, and both variables are important. In this example I have increased the size of the brush and, holding down ALT, I have created a crater along the pole of this sphere. Then I reduced the brush size and created a series of ridges along the edge of the crater to provide the feeling of an impact. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide5.PNG "Crater Project")

In this example I have made further refinements to the crater. By using a combination of brush size and intensity, and varying the numbers for each, | have managed to create a series of detailed ridges along the impact crater. This method can be applied to creating fine detail for characters, such as veins in muscles or worm-like textures in soil. To save any work, simply click on the Save As option in the right panel. The usual dialog box will open. Enter the name of the file and click save. Note: do not click Save As Document, from the options under Document in the top menu. This will only save the 2D maps and not the editable 3D file. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide6.PNG "Crater Project")

By zooming in and out of the model, and using the same brush tools with varying intensity and size, I have managed to create additional detail to the impact site of the crater. There are smaller craters from spreading debris, and a variety of ridges and troughs along the edge, spilling outwards onto the rest of the planet. While very much a rudimentary design, this example illustrates the power of ZBrush to create complex shapes from simple tools. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide7.PNG "Crater Project")

In this example I will be learning to create the bash mesh for my eventual alien character. Click on the golden Brush icon in the right panel, and from the option pop-up that opens, choose ZSphere. I will be using multiple ZSpheres to create the torso of the character, which is fairly simple to do in ZBrush. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide8.PNG "ZSphere")

To create this torso shape, first create the ZSphere. Then create another one by dragging over the first ZSphere. Repeat this process two to three times. Once the torso is in place, it is time to create the shoulders. Press X to bring up the mirror option. This will create an identical ZSphere across from where the original ZSphere is drawn. Drag out a smaller ZSphere. The mirror option will automatically create an identical ZSphere on the other side. These will be the shoulder joints. From the menu above, click on Move and drag out either of the shoulders to create the t-shape as shown in the image. Next click on Scale and drag across the bottom sphere to reduce the size. The overall result will resemble the torso in the image. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide9.PNG "Torso creation")

Drag out another ZSphere on the top of the torso for the neck. Rotate the canvas and ensure the torso is lined up properly, i.e. stacked vertically and neatly above each other. If the alignment of the torso is off, use the Move tool (top menu, next to the Edit button) to move the spheres individually into place. This may take some getting used to but the process is easy to master after a few attempts. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide10.PNG "Torso shoulders creation")

To create the head, simply drag out another ZSphere from the neck and scale it accordingly. For the arms, first click on the shoulder joints and drag out while pressing SHIFT to ensure the arms snap to the shoulder. Once that is done, let go of SHIFT and press CTRL to extend the arms out to the desired length. The mirror option will automatically do the same thing on the other side of the torso to ensure symmetry. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide11.PNG "Torso arms creation")

I have moved the arms and scaled the shoulders accordingly to give the character a larger and more imposing form since that is the character type I am learning to build. By scaling and moving the individual components of the model, I am able to adjust the weight and heft of the base mesh. Use the hotkeys, Q (draw), W (move), E (scale), and R (rotate) to cycle through the options quickly. These hotkeys are identical to the hotkeys for the same commands in Maya. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide12.PNG "Torso arms refinement")

Using the same principles of snapping (hold down SHIFT and drag) and extensions (hold down CTRL and drag) I have created additional ZSpheres for the lower arms of the model. Remember to keep rotating around the figure to ensure the alignment of the torso remains consistent and upright. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide13.PNG "Torso arms refinement")

I have created the hands by drawing an additional ZSphere, then created the thumb and three fingers by drawing smaller ZSpheres onto the hand. Because the mirror option is selected, the hand and fingers on the other side of the model are also created. This is an important step for both symmetry and speed of sculpting. In the next steps I will be working on articulating the fingers. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide14.PNG "Torso fingers creation")

Here is the basic form of the alien character I will eventually create, with its four fingers protruding from the hand area. At this point the fingers look stiff and not mobile. I will fix this in the next step by giving the fingers articulation and positioning them to resemble a humanoid anatomy. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide15.PNG "Torso fingers creation")
