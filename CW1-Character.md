## Introduction
This is my repository to track my progress in Advanced Modelling and Animation module at Goldsmiths College, University of London (2018). This documentation is for developing a character and documenting side experiments along the way to become more proficient at modelling, character animation, texturing, weight painting, and general games character scuplting. This documentation is specifically done for the Advanced Modelling and Animation module at Goldsmiths College, University of London (2017-2018) course. My aim is to learn ZBrush well enough to create 3D characters, and to document these learnings for future students of this course.

## Side Projects and Learnings
After installing ZBrush, open the programme. Click on the LightBox option, at the top left, to get rid of the pop-up menu that opens. I am beginning by learning how to create and sculpt a sphere as the starting point to learn the layout of ZBrush. Click on the golden S-shaped icon in the right panel. This will open the sculpting options. Click on the Sphere icon in the right panel. Also click on Make PolyMesh3D from the panel. Then click on the Edit button on the top panel (highlighted in yellow). Drag out a sphere onto the canvas. To zoom in, press CTRL + ALT and hold down the RMB. To rotate, simply drag the mouse around the canvas. To pan up, down, left and right, press ALT and hold down the RMB. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide1.PNG "First Attempt at ZBrush")

ZBrush has a host of brushes for use. Click on the Standard icon on the top-left, to access all of the brush options. Each of these brushes can be assigned a hotkey by hovering the cursor over the brush type, then pressing ALT and CTRL together. A pop-up dialog box will ask the user to enter a hotkey combination. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide2.PNG "Exploring the brushes")

To sculpt, simply drag the mouse or tablet pen over the mesh. This action begins warping the geometry according to the pen action. The default action raises or pulls out the mesh. To push in the mesh, hold down alt. In the image, the top section shows the mesh being pulled out, whereas the bottom section shows the mesh being pushed in. Holding down SHIFT will even out the mesh. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide3.PNG "First attempt at sculpting")

The mesh geometry can be sub-divided by clicking on the Divide option in the right panel. This allows the user to work on individual segments of the model. In this example, I have used one brush and a combination of pulls and pushes to give the sphere a roughened look. The potential to sculpt almost anything, from planets to alien creatures is virtually limitless. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide4.PNG "Geometry exploration")

The sculpting brush size can be adjusted using the brush size slider, located on the top horizontal bar. It can also be adjusted by hitting the space bar to bring up the menu. Both brush size and intensity can be adjusted in these ways, and both variables are important. In this example I have increased the size of the brush and, holding down ALT, I have created a crater along the pole of this sphere. Then I reduced the brush size and created a series of ridges along the edge of the crater to provide the feeling of an impact. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide5.PNG "Crater Project")

In this example I have made further refinements to the crater. By using a combination of brush size and intensity, and varying the numbers for each, | have managed to create a series of detailed ridges along the impact crater. This method can be applied to creating fine detail for characters, such as veins in muscles or worm-like textures in soil. To save any work, simply click on the Save As option in the right panel. The usual dialog box will open. Enter the name of the file and click save. Note: do not click Save As Document, from the options under Document in the top menu. This will only save the 2D maps and not the editable 3D file. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide6.PNG "Crater Project")

By zooming in and out of the model, and using the same brush tools with varying intensity and size, I have managed to create additional detail to the impact site of the crater. There are smaller craters from spreading debris, and a variety of ridges and troughs along the edge, spilling outwards onto the rest of the planet. While very much a rudimentary design, this example illustrates the power of ZBrush to create complex shapes from simple tools. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide7.PNG "Crater Project")

This sketch forms the basis of my concept for the alien creature I would like to create. The sketch concepts are a practical brainstorming over a period of time to determine not just the character but also the entire narrative around which it will grow from, fit into, and perhaps most importantly, communicate. Several decisions were considered before the I fixed on one direction. This decision includes the following factors that not only determine the direction of my sculpting process but also the narrative surrounding each sculpt:

• Alien character of humanoid form<br/>• Benign but powerful creature<br/>• Small in stature but nontheless posessing of presence

I imagine the alien to be from a water world similar to earth, which provides the backdrop of the anatomy and ecorche. Since the origins are watery, it may be assumed the alien would possess a strong upper body, resembling a swimmer, with either webbed feet or fewer and longer toes to glide through an aqueous medium. I am still deciding on whether the alien should be biped or quadraped, but since the origin similarities are humanoid, biped seems a better option. Given the choice between a high-tech modern world and a high-tech ancient world, I am going with the latter, since an ancient world offers more in terms of basing the sculpt in reality. I am therefore conceptualising an alien that resembles a cross between Admiral Ackbar and Jar Jar Binks from Star Wars, since both are of liquid dwellings and are formed accordingly. The alien will therefore have a certain aqueous stature that mimics a museum-like artifact in which curves, tendrils, top-weightiness, and Amazonian skin markings come together to define the alien's presence. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Alien-Sketch-Concept.jpg "Alien Sketch Concept")

In this example I will be learning to create the bash mesh for my eventual alien character, now that the concept document is in place and the narrative finalised. Click on the golden Brush icon in the right panel, and from the option pop-up that opens, choose ZSphere. I will be using multiple ZSpheres to create the torso of the character, which is fairly simple to do in ZBrush. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide8.PNG "ZSphere")

To create this torso shape, first create the ZSphere. Then create another one by dragging over the first ZSphere. Repeat this process two to three times. Once the torso is in place, it is time to create the shoulders. Press X to bring up the mirror option. This will create an identical ZSphere across from where the original ZSphere is drawn. Drag out a smaller ZSphere. The mirror option will automatically create an identical ZSphere on the other side. These will be the shoulder joints. From the menu above, click on Move and drag out either of the shoulders to create the t-shape as shown in the image. Next click on Scale and drag across the bottom sphere to reduce the size. The overall result will resemble the torso in the image. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide9.PNG "Torso creation")

Drag out another ZSphere on the top of the torso for the neck. Rotate the canvas and ensure the torso is lined up properly, i.e. stacked vertically and neatly above each other. If the alignment of the torso is off, use the Move tool (top menu, next to the Edit button) to move the spheres individually into place. This may take some getting used to but the process is easy to master after a few attempts. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide10.PNG "Torso shoulders creation")

To create the head, simply drag out another ZSphere from the neck and scale it accordingly. For the arms, first click on the shoulder joints and drag out while pressing SHIFT to ensure the arms snap to the shoulder. Once that is done, let go of SHIFT and press CTRL to extend the arms out to the desired length. The mirror option will automatically do the same thing on the other side of the torso to ensure symmetry. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide11.PNG "Torso arms creation")

I have moved the arms and scaled the shoulders accordingly to give the character a larger and more imposing form since that is the character type I am learning to build. By scaling and moving the individual components of the model, I am able to adjust the weight and heft of the base mesh. Use the hotkeys, Q (draw), W (move), E (scale), and R (rotate) to cycle through the options quickly. These hotkeys are identical to the hotkeys for the same commands in Maya. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide12.PNG "Torso arms refinement")

Using the same principles of snapping (hold down SHIFT and drag) and extensions (hold down CTRL and drag) I have created additional ZSpheres for the lower arms of the model. Remember to keep rotating around the figure to ensure the alignment of the torso remains consistent and upright. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide13.PNG "Torso arms refinement")

I have created the hands by drawing an additional ZSphere, then created the thumb and three fingers by drawing smaller ZSpheres onto the hand. Because the mirror option is selected, the hand and fingers on the other side of the model are also created. This is an important step for both symmetry and speed of sculpting. In the next steps I will be working on articulating the fingers. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide14.PNG "Torso fingers creation")

Here is the basic form of the alien character I will eventually create, with its four fingers protruding from the hand area. At this point the fingers look stiff and not mobile. I will fix this in the next step by giving the fingers articulation and positioning them to resemble a humanoid anatomy. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide15.PNG "Torso fingers creation")

The fingers now have a much more realistic humanoid feel, despite being only four digits. I created additional ZSpheres along where the articulation joints in the middle of the digits should be. Then I moved these joints individually into place till the result was satisfactory. I also moved the hand joints from where the digits protrude, and scaled down the fingers, while scaling up the thumb for greater visual contrast. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide16.PNG "Torso fingers articulation")

I have created the hips, hip joints, and extended these joints out using the SHIFT snapping and CTRL extension options to create the alien’s thighs and legs. Since this creature will be a humanoid-type alien, the basic human anatomy has to be preserved but with a few fundamental alterations to the overall form. I have therefore given the alien spindly legs, and moved out the back and hip muscles to provide a weightier feel along the waist, rather than the legs which do not hold most of the weight for this species. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide17.PNG "Torso hips and legs")

Hitting the A key will bring up the model view of the mesh, like the sphere example in the previous section. The model view provides a clay-sculpt perspective to assess the overall shape of the creature. Hitting the A key again will return to the ZSphere view. It is a good idea to toggle between these views often to gain an overall perspective of how the model is shaping up. In the next step I will be creating the feet for the alien humanoid. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide18.PNG "Torso perspective")

I have created the basic foot by adding a ZSphere to the base of the leg then extending it out using the SHIFT and CTRL process I have been practicing with so far. I want this alien to have somewhat warped but still recognisable feet, which flow with the heft of the top torso. With the basic foot in place, the next step is to create the toes. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide19.PNG "Torso legs perspective")

I have created the toes and altered the foot shape for the alien. Like the fingers, each foot only has four toes. The inner toes are significantly larger than the rest, and the outer toe articulates in towards the rest of the toes. This anatomy gives the impression of a primate-like species that probably inhabits a tree-like world not that dissimilar to the Earth. It is important, while modelling, to realise the narrative of the piece for which the character is being created; this helps to keep the form and function of the character in check, not only to fit into the world it is destined for, but also to perform its animations in the intended manner. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide20.PNG "Torso toes")

Here is the alien humanoid character in the model-sculpt view. At this stage it is getting easier to see the character’s ultimate form and direction in which the modelling will take place. The overall shape is still human-like but the heavier top torso, coupled with the arms, four fingers, and relatively spindly legs offer the illusion that this being is not entirely human. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide21.PNG "Torso complete")

With the model now complete and ready for sculpting, it is time to turn the model into what Zbrush calls an Adaptive Skin. This process is straightforward: click on the Adaptive Skin option from the right panel. In the density option, choose 2, then click Make Adaptive Skin. ZBrush creates an icon for the adaptive skin in the tools panel above, top right. Click on the icon that has been created. At this point the ZSpheres can no longer be accessed and pressing A will not do anything. From here on, all modelling and sculpting will take place on this new adaptive skin. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide22.PNG "Adaptive skin")

In this section I am using the Move brush (not to be confused with the Move tool) to move the geometry mesh. The Move brush moves the mesh around to create shapes. I have used the move brush to give the figure more heft by sculpting muscles around the arms, and bringing in the clavicle to create a more pronounced form. I have also refined the shoulder muscles and chest area to provide added girth to the figure. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide23.PNG "Move brush")

Further refinements have been made to the calves, chest, and most prominently the head, which will immediately identify the character as an alien. The Move brush tool has a mirror option, which can be toggled using the X key so that all refinements made to one side of the mesh are automatically updated to the corresponding alternates. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide24.PNG "Sculpting chest and shoulders")

It is important to zoom into individual parts of the mesh to adjust each section. In this step I am focusing on making the fingers more wrinkled and articulated, with mild depressions representing where finger nails would have grown. Similarly, the knuckles need to be protruded and adjusted accordingly so that the humanoid look is preserved, but not so much that the hand is mistaken for entirely that of a human’s. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide25.PNG "Sculpting fingers")

Still using the Move brush tool, I have given the figure a stomach line that dips in just below the wide chest. The figure’s chest muscles protrude far more than that of a human being’s but not so much as to break the line of belief. Likewise, the musculature along the figure’s front, back and side has been modelled by referring to images of the human anatomy, then varied for alien-like differences. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide26.PNG "Sculpting stomach")

At times work will need to be carried out on specific parts of the model and not others, that will nonetheless get influenced during refinements. In such cases, the Mask tool is extremely handy. Hold down CTRL and drag across the figure, covering any part which should not interact with the brush. The area covering the figure will darken, indicating a protective mask has been applied. Sculpting can now take place in the lighter areas, which will have no affect on the darker, masked areas. Using the mask tool, I was able to articulate the calves independently of the upper thighs since that area is protected (uneditable). ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide27.PNG "Mask Tool")

It is also possible to invert the mask to cover the parts previously unprotected, by holding down CTRL and clicking the mouse, or tapping the pen. The mask will invert across the figure accordingly. To remove the mask, hold down CTRL and long tap with the pen on the tablet. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide28.PNG "Mask Tool")

Holding CTRL and SHIFT and dragging over the mesh isolates that section of the mesh, which is useful when a particular part of the model needs concentrated attention. In this example I have isolated the back of the alien to create this face-like form onto the skin, which blends into the spine and musculature of the alien. Once the isolated part of the modelling work is completed, hold CTRL and SHIFT and tap or drag in an empty space on the canvas, away from the model. Holding CTRL and SHIFT and ALT will isolate specific sections of the mesh. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide29.PNG "Isolation Tool")

When viewing the model in polyframe mode, it may be apparent that in some areas the model is lacking sufficient polygons to create volume. In this case, Dynamesh is critical. Dynamesh is a tool built into ZBrush that evens out the number of polygons, increasing the count where necessary, to provide smoother topology. Turn on Dynamesh under the geometry tab in the right panel, then go over the model using the same Move brush. Dynamesh will fill in the polygon count wherever changes to the model are made. To commit the Dynamesh changes, hold down CTRL and drag over an empty part of the canvas. In the example I have further refined the torso and arms of the alien, and created an Anubis-like jackal head. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide30.PNG "Head Sculpting with DynaMesh")

With the basic torso and body in place, it is time to sculpt in the actual musculature, or the ecorche, that is the human body without the skin. It is useful to have a reference image of the ecorche when sculpting the musculature. I have used the clay build-up brush here and by varying the brush size, I have sculpted out the muscle lines and cavities along the face. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide31.PNG "Muscle Sculpting")

By using the Clay Build-Up, Dam Standard, Move, and Smooth brushes, and keeping a reference of the human anatomy in front, I have managed to sculpt more detailed musculature and armaments onto the alien. The dam standard brush makes incisions and grooves, which are necessary for cutting into the model to emulate the depressions and niches in the anatomy. The carving is done with a combination of these brushes as well as adjusting each’s size and intensity. In the next section, I will be working on the back of the alien. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide32.PNG "Veins Sculpting")

For the back and spine of the alien I have used a more intricate pattern but still following the basic human anatomy. The spine is readily articulated along the alien’s back, culminating in a swath of extruding bones that wrap around the alien’s waist, hips, and also forearms, elbows, and wrists. I am planning on using these skeletal structures as armour grappling for when I learn and work on the clothes for the alien. I will next be working on the head and legs. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide33.PNG "Back and Bones Sculpting")

I have sculpted the alien’s basic head shape, complete with eye sockets and bone structure. In most cases, these figures represent evil, and so returning to my narrative, I wanted to create an alien who is scary-looking but also possesses an immediately recognisable benevolence. This I hope to achieve from the shape and focus of the eyes. The eye sockets have therefore been sculpted to look intense but wise through elongated and raised lids, a high forehead, and gently sloping bone curves around the roof of the socket. I drew this inspiration by studying images of the Buddha and other deities of power and peace. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide34.PNG "Eyes and Face Sculpting")

Likewise, the back of the head has a protruding bone that is emblematic of the Buddha’s tied up hair, representing the wisdom of the Bodhisatva. The markings around the head and ears hint towards temple carvings, while still assimilating into the overall skin patterns of the alien. To augment the powerful but benevolent motif, I have given the alien pointed ears but again folded back at a gently-sloping angle, reminiscent of a cow more than a cat. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide35.PNG "Back of Head Sculpting")

In this step I have focused on detailing the hands. While this is an alien, the humanoid ecorche requires visible similarity for body parts, and the hands are vital. I have sculpted the palms and created articulation lines along the fingers. I used the Standard brush to push in the palm, then switched to the Dam standard brush to make the cuts and refinements along the edges of the palm and fingers. The Clay build-up brush was then used to add extra detailing along the finger lines and fleshy spot of the palm. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide36.PNG "Hands Sculpting")

I have extruded the knuckles and sculpted the shape to resemble the rest of the boniness of the character. Because the character only has four fingers, the joints system will be slightly different to that of the regular human hand. In this step I used a variety of brushes to create the gnarly knuckles, then pushed the mesh in where the nails are. Additional detailing created the veins and fleshiness for the fingers without sacrificing the spindly quality that defines the creature. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide37.PNG "Knuckles Sculpting")

I have begun work on detailing the thighs. While this creature’s apparel (discussed later) is mostly absent for the top torso, I wanted the bottom half to be a combination of fleshy veins, swirly fabric, and leather-like calf huggers for the area below the knee and to the ankle. I used a combination of brushes to sculpt the overall shape, then refined each cut using mostly the Dam standard brush with varying thickness, brush size, and focal intensity. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide38.PNG "Thighs Sculpting")

Likewise for the lower leg, I used the brushes discussed so far with a high positive focal intensity value, which resulted in a smoother, more voluminous sculpt. I thickened this area using the Clay build-up brush. Seams were then created along the sides and back and fine stitches were cut into the seams to provide that leather-like look. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide39.PNG "Shin Sculpting")

For the back of the calf covers, I used a similar stitch pattern, but interwove the seams with a series of ridges that resemble the alien’s bone-like structure. The lumpy musculature is also evident beneath the leather material, which culminates in a solid band around each foot. This motif of bands has been applied throughout the alien’s body to continue the narrative of a civilised yet ancient race.  ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide40.PNG "Pants Sculpting")

I have sculpted the feet of the alien and created much more detail. This is a four-toed creature and as such the musculature, joints system, and weight distribution is similar but not identical to human beings. I used the Move brush to further space the toes into a splayed formation to add weight and anchor to the model. The nails are similar to human beings except for the toenail, which has a pronounced protrusion. The ankle bones, additional veins and micro muscles were added and fine-tuned to fit with the anatomy of this four-toed biped. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide41.PNG "Feet and toes Sculpting")

The bottom of the feet have also been sculpted to match the musculature of a four-toed biped. The soles are more severely curved than that of a regular human being’s, and the heels have been reduced since the weight distribution follows along the flattened points of the toes. The bones on each toe were positioned using the Move brush to reflect a load-bearing point of contact. The little toe is almost as long as the rest of the toes to provide stability to the load-bearing distribution, and is commensurate with such an anatomy. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide42.PNG "Soles and heels Sculpting")

Because each body part is anatomically related and distributed along every other part, it is important to create a harmonious structure. In this alien, the weight of the body is at the top, and the wide, splayed feet counteract this bulk. The mid-section is therefore much smaller but stronger. I used a combination of brushes to create lighter musculature along the mid-section, then refined these into Mayan shapes resembling a temple guarded by a scorpion – a motif that assimilates well into the narrative. The upper chest muscles are wider to support the top. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide43.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

The face is the most noticeable quality of this alien, and I wanted to create enough detail for visual interest without sacrificing the expression of menacing benevolence. I used the Clay brush to add additional volume to the side of the face, then used the Move brush to pull out the tendrils. A variety of other brushes were then used to shape the tendrils into naturally-occurring appendages that hang from the face of the alien. During animation I intend to make these tendrils flap as the creature moves, and use overlap to provide a more genuine motion. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide44.PNG "Face Sculpting")

This is the sculpted alien model after all of the above-mentioned steps were completed. In the next stage I will be focusing more on the clothes and areas of visual interest. I will also be exploring the Boolean tools in ZBrush and adding further geometry and topology variants to the model to both augment the sculpture as well as to further my own learning of ZBrush. I will also be exploring alpha channels, levels, transform tools, and the Gizmo 3D tool used in transformations in ZBrush. To save the work, press CTRL and S and save the file as usual. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide45.PNG "Tuning Stage Sculpting")

This is a rendering of the sculpture of the alien as it would be if cast in pewter as a collectible, or a game token for a board game version. The rendering shows the alien from the front, back, and side view to provide an idea of the sculpting relationship between the three axes of the model. This three-axis perspective is critical to animation since each side of the model needs to be considered for its anatomy and basic form and structure so that IK rigging can be properly applied. The silvery texture of pewter has the additional benefit of highlighting subtle details in the skin and form of the model, that clay casts may at times conceal. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Alien-Pewter-Rendering.png "Alien Pewter Render")


# Character Creation Stage 1: Mood Boards / Paper Design / Initial Sketches


# Stage 2: Initial Sketch Blockout in 3D
Now that the initial sketches and mood boards designs have been confirmed I am starting work on the initial blockout in 3D. I have used the paper designs to construct a basic shape of the squat, three-fingered humanoid miner. This miner's fingers represent the three-clawed drill as well as the initial cruetly of amputation on the fingers (as tied-in with the storyline) to create a slightly grotesque form. The basic shape has been constructed in ZBrush. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide48.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")
 
Further refinements have been done to the sculpt form. In this example I am using a t-pose to sculpt the miner as this will make it easier to rig later on, given the miner is a humanoid form. The basic broccoli-shaped form for the miner remains in the squat, suppressed look and feel for the miner. At all times, it is important to show the disfigured and defeated air that these slave miners carry about with them. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide49.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")
 
I have used the transform tool in ZBrush to begin shaping the primary and secondary forms. At this point, topology is not a concern, and will come into action in Stage 3. For now, I am simply moving the mesh about and scultping on the t-pose model to get the overall look and feel required to demonstrate the miner and his / her basic outline. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide50.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")
 
I am using Dynamesh inside ZBrush to distribute polygons evenly and to aid in shaping the sculpt as desired. The eventual look and feel will be that of a squat, humanoid character who exudes a defeated air, as characterised by the slightly bent body and distorted appendages (almost broken and fixed hastily together) which lends a sense of pathos to the game's non-essential character. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide51.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")
 
Because the miner is squat, I want him to be overweight in an unappealing, non-prosperous way. I am using the clay tubes brush to add form to the stomach and knees to get that fatty, bulbous build-up that patients of beri-beri face. The distinct deficiency in vitamins causes weak jowls and folds along the stomach, indicative of sickness and disease. I am going for a similar look with the miner here, who after all is a slave of the Mining Federation and is treated as such. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide52.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")
 
Likewise, for the back, buttocks, and behind the knees, I am using the clay tubes to build up the same diseased look and feel that I have done for the front. I am also considering at this point that the miners will not have trousers per say, but long shirts that cover their mid-sections, like the clothing worn by prisoners during the inquisition. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide53.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")
 
I have more or less completed the basic form for the miner and will shortly begin filling in the finer details. The stomach and joints have been meshed into shape and the overall form is coming through. The squatness is also starting to show. In the next few sections I will consider the polygon fills and begin working on the topology and edge flows. For now, the miner's basic form is ready for further processing and refinement. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide54.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")
 
In the Line Fills view in ZBrush, the mesh looks even and well-distributed, which will aid in detailing later on. The active mesh also supports smooth edge flows and the UV maps, which will come later, will be used along this mesh. The miner's form will also be Dynameshed a few more times the retopologised to fit with the number of desired polygons for a PC game. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide55.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")
 
I have begun working on the basic forms of the miner's face. Because the miner will have no voice (literally, since there is a very small mouth) the eyes and nose will carry the characteristics of the face and communicate the expression of being a lost, pathetic figure being forced to carry out back-breaking work on a hostile planet. This expression needs to be communicated through the lost, puppy-dog look that the eyeballs, eyebrows, and nose will convey. At this point, I am focusing on the basic features but keeping the overall expression in mind from the outset itself. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide56.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")
 
Further sculpting work and Dynameshing on the backside has given the miner a more humanoid look. The buttocks have been further shaped and rounded to match the human form. I also want to capture the distresses on the back and around the glutes to show the strains on these muscles from heavy lifting that work of such kind creates. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide57.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")
 
The basic form, curves, dips, and crevices along the body have been completed. In the next sections I will be focusing on edge flows together with more refinements and detailing. The polygon count will also become a major factor and the basic shape will be further sculpted to create a more riggable character for fluid animation. I will be rigging in both Maya and Mixamo to test the character's movements across a wide range of motion. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide58.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")



# Stage 3: Retopologising and Edge Flows

I will be using sub-tools to separate the hair, clothing, and accessories of the miner. In this case, I have begun masking out the basic hairline of the miner. The final hairs of the miner will be generated separately using ZBrush's FiberMesh, but I first wanted to have a basic platform from which I can then generate the hair. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide59.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

I have extracted the hair onto its own layer and have adjusted the thicknesses and variant distribution. The miner's hair has been masked to work only on that segment. I have also cleaned up the edges of the hairline so that when I eventually draw the FiberMesh, the lines will look more natural rather than artificially sprouting off the top of the head. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide60.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

Further refinements to the hairs' growth lines along which the FiberMesh will sprout. It must be noted that the FiberMesh will be used to create a more broccoli-like hair sprout, rather than the stylised look at this stage. The hair is just for referencing at this point. It must also be noted that the FiberMesh, together with the sculpt, will be retopologised to reduce polygon count. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide61.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

I have created grooves and strands along where the FiberMesh will eventually be applied. I want the hair to sprout naturally along hairlines that follow the overall contours of the miner's head. I have also kept the hair as a separate sub-tool for isolation and further refinement when it will become necessary later on. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide62.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

Work has begun on the miner's shirt. I started by masking out the area where the shirt will be, taking care to follow the musculature and natural fold lines of the miner's body, which I will augment later on. The shirt is to be longish, since the miner will not have trousers, and will therefore fall along the front and side contours of the figure. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide63.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

I have extracted the shirt as a separate sub-tool and begun working on the edges to create a rough, hewn look, reminescent of hessop or open-weave knit that is commonly associated with poor man's clothing. When I eventually create the UVs and textures, I'd like these textures to fall unevenly across the body, conforming to the body of the miner. At this stage I am also reworking the symmetry of the mask to prevent absolute mirroring that may give the shirt a more tailored look. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide64.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

Likewise, I am working on the back of the shirt to cover half of the miner's buttocks. This is deliberately to imbue the character with a sense of despair, poverty, and general lack of humanity. These traits are necessary to drive the unfeeling character of the game's Mining Federation, and is reinforced not just in the features and build of the miner but in the clothes and shoes as well. The shirt is uneven but long enough to cover and fold around the necessary aspects of the miner's form to check the boxes for modesty, given the game's rating in the UK, US and EU. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide65.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

I am now working on the miner's eyebrows and eye sockets, both of which will work off each other to further impart the look of despair, mixed with mild defiance perhaps, to imbue the game with a sense of pathos. I have Dynameshed the face and hollowed out the eye sockets, giving them a bit of a droop at the ends. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide66.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

I have created separate eyeball objects and meshed them into the eye sockets. A further, smaller object has been used with greater albedo placeholders (UVs will be created later for this) have been used to create a shine in the eyeballs. The eyebrows have also been thickened and textured to give the miner a heavier appearance. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide67.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

The shirt has been further refined to curve over the belly button while still keeping a natural fall with gravity. I have also begun working on the boots for the miner. Note that the miner, though humanoid in form, has two distinct differences in the appendages: the fingers are three-clawed to reinforce the idea of a drill, and the feet curve outward instead of facing forward. The angle of the feet are deliberately tilted to still bear realistic weights of the body but will move with minute differences when animated. I want the feet to move as though they are being dragged, rather than a simplistic human walk cycle, which I feel will take away from the pathos of the miner. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide68.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

I have extracted the boots of the miner and worked on furthering defining the musculature beneath. This makes the boots look soft and flimsy, rather than hard and solid, since the miner is not provided with quality materials of any sort by the Mining Federation. The soft, almost sock-like features of the boots attest to their poor quality. Further ragging along the edges add age to the boots. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide69.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

I have begun working on the mouth. I want to give the miner a simple-minded look, almost dumb in appearance but without giving the mouth too much importance since the miner is not one who voices his opinons or speaks up. The mouth is therefore small, and the tongue protrudes a bit beyond the thinned lips — again a sign of exertion that is expected of people doing heavy chores and work. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide70.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

I have added wrist bands to the miner's wrists, a symbol of further oppression. These wrist bands have been created using the same techniques as the hair and shirt. The eyebrows have been given a more boney texture and the eyes have been further drooped to evoke greater pathos and desperation. Further refinements to the figure's frontal muscultature has also been carried out. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide71.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

Likewise, the back of the miner has been refined to show strains along the muscles, from heavy lifting, as well as protruding bones along the spine and elbows. At this stage, I am building subtle differences into the form and musculature of the miner to create some distinction between the miner's humanoid form, and pure human shape. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide72.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

Further refinements in folds, muscle shape, tone, and sculpting have been carried out across the miner's form and the various sub-tools for the miner's clothes, hair, features, eyes, and wrist bands. I have used a variety of brushes and basic topoloising tools to achieve the lines of interest. The primary forms of the miner are now complete. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide73.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

I am using the Line Fill tool to assess the polygon count and to examine the miner's overall sculpt symmetry and integrity. So far the figure, though high in polygon count, works for the overall look and feel I am going for. The polygon count will be fixed and amendments made to the mesh in the next step. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide74.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

I have used the ZRemesher tool and adaptive topology to retopologise the mesh. The initial sculpt held over a million polygons. After using the ZRemesher tool and adaptive topologies, I have reduced the mesh to 10795 polygons — suitable for a low-poly game that my team and I are building. Retopologising has also managed to maintain the overall integrity of the model. I will apply ZRemesher to all the different sub-tools, although the main figure (shown here) is of greatest priority. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide75.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

The miner has been retopologised with smooth edge flows and captured symmetry. The model is now ready for subdivision and further refinement as well as UV mapping and texturing, which will come later on. In the next stage I will work on tertiary details and the FiberMesh for the miner's hair. I will also create UV textures and use Quixel to paint the model. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide76.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")



# Stage 4: Capturing Details from Initial Sculpt and UV UnWrapping and Mapping

With initial retopoligising completed I am now working on masking out the major and minor areas of the sculpt for further refinement. In this case, with the sculpt's total polygon count at approximately 11,000, I can now begin working on tertiary details without exceeding the recommended polygon count of 30,000. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide77.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

Completed retopologising for the main body and started retopologising the remaining sub-tools. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide78.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

Further tertiary refinements have been made to the body, features, face, and clothes which will be used during baking out texture maps and applying these to the overall form for animation. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide79.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

Similar tertiary treatments have been applied to the back of the sculpt where texture maps will be used for the back of the shirt and body. I have also applied faux occlusion to begin getting an idea of what the eventual materials will look like in the game. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide80.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

With the basic retopologising completed and materials surfaces set, I am using an alpha to create subtle texturing on the model. In this case I am using the Alpha 23 brush to add fine-line muscultature and defects to the skin, pores, and clothes for the miner. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide81.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

I have dragged out and re-sorted the alphas to define the musculature of the figure along the eyes and face to further augment the miner's appearance and expressions. The same Alpha 23 amendments have been used on the clothes and boots of the miner. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide82.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

Further alpha brushes have been used to add micro-tears and wrinkles to the miner's shirt along the edges, cuffs, and hemline. A textured pattern in the front is reminescent of the Blumbos Caves paintings to reinforce the idea of primitive cultures, which the miners represent in the game. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide83.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

In this step I have begun masking out the areas that will potentially contain hair. The masks represent where the FiberMesh will be applied to create hair textures, giving the miner a more hirsuit look and feel. However, I am also mindful of the strain of fiber meshes on polygon count and so will bake these place holders for the time being and re-initialise masking at a later time if feasible. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide84.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

I have created a fiber mesh for the hair on the miner's head. The strands, direction, and gravitational pull have all been adjusted several times to provide the appropriate look and feel for the miner. The sculpt is also getting closer to the broccoli style which I was planning on at the beginning of this project a few weeks earlier. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide85.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

This top view shows the hair of the miner, which is mildly thinning, thus affording the miner's age and adding to the pathos of the character in the game as a slave of the Mining Federation. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide86.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

Minor works on the belly hair along with some scultping around the flab of the stomach. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide87.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

I have completed the hair and also added some lumpy textures to the miner's legs to add a more diseased look. The miner is almost ready and in the next step I will conduct a few high bypass renders to assess what the miner will look like in the game, as well as the sculpt's suitability for rigging and animation. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide88.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

A BPR rendering of the miner: the overall look and feel has been achieved and UVs can now be applied, along with texturing, to the model. The t-pose is holding up and will be used to rig the model in Maya, as well as for secondary testing in Mixamo. The ambient occlusions are falling off appropriately and the edges of the shirt provide well-structured shadows along the model's form. The hair and general gait of the miner affords an almost ape-like, primitive look to the miner, who squat and stocky and will move accordingly. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide89.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")


# Stage 5: Creating an Animation Rig and Weight Painting

A check of the polygon count has bumped the number to 50000. This is due to the FiberMesh, which I do not require in such a high count. I will use the ZRemesher to once again retopologise the model and bring the overall count to a useable 30000 polygon count, which is ideal for our low-poly PC game. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide90.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

I have begun to retopologise and remesh the sculpt individually for each sub-tool to bring the polygon count to the appropriate level for weight painting, rigging, animation, and eventual export out for the game. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide91.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

I have retopologised and recast the hair on the model to the body mesh. The total polygon count is at 23580 and is therefore ideal for use. In Maya I will once again retopologise the model within the rigging workcycle, then begin rigging the model for animation. At this stage the model is almost ready and one more BPR is required for final evaluation before exporting the model to Maya for rigging and animation. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide92.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

The BPR has been completed and the occlusions look good. The polygon count is ideal and the mesh has been cast along the new topology. The model is ready for importing into Maya and for animation.![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide93.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

I have imported the model into Maya from ZBrush. The model's shape and integrity of the sculpt has been preserved. As expected, the hair from the fiber mesh has been thinned appropriately to fit with the required polygon count for when this model is exported into Unity. I have also added two slits to the front of the model's shirt in Maya, to (i) add additional interest to the model's torso, and (ii) to allow greater edge manipulation for when the model bends forward or swivels during animation. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide94.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

Likewise, the back of the model works fine in Maya and the sculpt has preseved its integrity over the export. These areas, it is expected, will also receive texturing uniformly in Quixel given the allowable polygon count and smooth surface topology and edge flows. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide95.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

After another round of minor retopologising, the hair of the model has come out exactly as I want it. The figure is now being set up for auto rigging, using Maya's in-built autorigging tool. I want to model to not just complete simple animation movements such as waving, but also want to test it for swivels, walk-cycles, and simple arm and three-finger joint movements, which I will film and insert into this report. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide96.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

I have completed the UV unwrapping and built a texture (Photoshop and Pixabay) to apply as the material for the miner's shirt. The UV mapping has been completed and isolated for each part of the shirt. The texture has been appended to the model and the range-opacity ratio has been bumped down so that only a minor texture overlay is sitting over the fabric. This is to preserve the polygon and resource count for when I export the model into the game, which has a low-polygon look and feel. I will work more on the UV and textures for the model but the primary UV procedure has been completed. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide123.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

Likewise, for each section, fold, and fabric bend on the miner's shirt, I have mapped individual projection points so that each UV is numbered and corresponds to the unique sub-textures that I have created from the main texture in Photoshop and Quixel Suite 2. The collars, underarms, sleeve terminals, hemline, stomach folds, and hanging rips have all been individually sub-textured. The process is painstaking and can be time-consuming but the result is worth it, even if these fine details are not fully appreciated during gameplay. I have learned and confident in being able to map UVs and assign individual sub-textures from the main texture - a useful and essential skill for character creation. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide124.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

I have outfitted the rig with the adjusted IK control points, and will now begin mirroring weight painting along the arms and legs to achieve the desired motion in animation. The human IK controls needed to be positioned manually to account for the inverse kinematics, which did not align perfectly during auto-rigging and so each influence had to be adjusted in increments. Most of the model was a mix of grey and white weights - which means the greys needed correcting. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide108.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

In this step I have adjusted the size of the joints to achieve greater control of the IK points, which makes for easier weight painting. Once these joints have been adjusted and balanced along the IK hierarchy, I will begin to work on the hierarchy itself, using weight painting (manual and automatic) to achieve the best animation effect through this rig. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide109.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

I have created a joint hierarchy to bind the skin of the model into a singular form that makes it easier to weight paint. I have also discarded the histories of the model to achieve a single, fluid form for rigging. A few influences have also been picked up and selected influences for weight painting. Six of these joints were manually weight painted in this manner. Note that B on the keyboard adjusts brush size, and the + and - keys adjust influence of the weight brush. I also normalised weights to interactive. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide110.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

Completed some soft deformations along the hips, which are least used by the model, given its function in the game, which is to mainly use his hands and upper torso. I also used a bit of scale in weight painting to reduce too many influences. In general this is not a recommended practice but in this case it worked given the simplified influence structure of the IK rig. Also, the upper shoulders needed a little less influence for greater normalisation, still adding up to 1 at all times. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide111.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

With the basic weight painting distribution completed, I have mirrored skin weights and painted along the vertices - values between 0 and 1. I flooded a selection of vertices initially using some of the vertex selections marquees, which brought some of the wireframes back - an error in Maya which is fixed by turning wire frames on and off - then used orthographic view to marquee then paint the necessary selections. I also expanded the selections for greater control over these joints. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide112.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")


# Stage 6 + 7: Creating a Simple Animation and Exporting to Game Engine and Playback

I have amended the Maya plug-ins manager box to accept exporting across the GPU for faster renders and Quad Draw symmetry in Maya. Once this step is completed, Maya will make use of the GPU at approximately 125 FPS to ensure faster and smoother renders and animation loading times. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide97.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

After importing the model into Quixel for substance painting and texturing - simple textures given the requirements of the game - I also optimised the mesh in Quixel once more. Quixel optimises existing topologies, rather than overlaying a new one, and so any rough or inconsistent edge flows have been smoothened out further and optimised in Quixel during texturing and substance painting. Once the texturing is complete, more CPU might be required since I would like the model to render with and without texturing for when I am rigging. A GPU re-export is therefore required to maximise computer hardware. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide114.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

I have exported the sculpt into a GPU alembic file, then reimported the file into a new scene. Once this is done I can begin Quad Draw for low poly management (since our game is in low-poly) then draw up the necessary UVs and apply the shaders and textures in Quixel. Because the miner is a non-game element and will be performing aesthetic functions only, I have kept the Quixel substances to a minimum, and used only light tearing and stained textures along the front of the shirt. Likewise, the skin is mostly monotone, except behind the knees and between the fingers, where accumulated dirt may be observed. Most importantly are the eyes, which I will add more detail to provide a teary, sad look to augment the miner's overall despair. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide98.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

I have completed the shading works and UVs in Maya, and applied the rough shirt texture in Quixel. I am now creating a rig from scratch for the miner. In this scene I have used Maya's auto-rig feature but have worked with the step-by-step mode to assign individual IK bones and joints to the sculpture since the model is humanoid but not exactly human, and so the auto-rig in this case would create odd movements, owing to the squatness and broccoli-shaped torso of the miner. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide99.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

I have manually created individually-controlled IK rig points to control the miner. These points can be programmed in Python to coincide with Unity's rigging and animation feature, as well as provide a comparative frame with the auto-rigging features in Mixamo, which I will use to test and animate the miner in a variety of poses. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide100.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

The individually-controlled points are lining up along the spine (in four compression points and two expansion points) and also distributed evenly along the shoulders, elbows, chin, mid-section, waist, hips, knees, ankles, and toes. The Quad Draw technique used earlier helps to ensure the mesh receives a more even distribution of rigging points. Therefore, even though the Quad Draw is not essential, it is still a vital step to drive a more fluid ann believable rig. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide101.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

The rig, on its own, can be seen with the points of motion. The squatness of the hips and longer ankle-to-foot joints follow the humanoid form of the miner. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide102.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

With the rig setup and in place, and the IK schemas working, the character can now be posed in a variety of ways. In this scene I have positioned the miner in a classic A-pose. The IK is working and the miner is able to hold the stance as necessary. In the next few scenes I will experiment with more complicated poses to test the tension and integrity of the mesh and make minor adjustments where needed to fix any breakages in the mesh. Notice also, the eyes have been substance-painted in Quixel and is rendering correctly with a slight liquidy-tearing feel that connotes the miner's despair. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide103.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

In this pose, the miner is doing a slight squash, and the height of the model has therefore been compensated by slightly elongating the poles to preserve volume. The miner is still able to hold this more extreme rig, which is advantageous should the miner character be used in the game. At this stage, the group is discussing and evaluating whether the inclusion of additional game elements is prudent in producing the final result. Therefore the miner may not make it to the final game but I am nonetheless working on the character any way for use in my portfolio and perhaps another project after this. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide104.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

In this pose, the miner is in an X-stance. Once again, the rig is working fine and the miner is able to hold the pose with no breakage or tears in the mesh. The light contusions are part of the folds in the fabric, as a result of a thin layer of clay buildup, which affords the shirt a more realistic look and feel. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide105.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

The final test rig pose is the basketball slam-dunk stance. The miner's wrists, elbows, and fingers are all contorted along the rig's IK joints and works fine. Once again volume is preserved through the squash and expand technique. The miner will not be expected to make such complex poses, but should the need arise, the model and accompanying rig is so far up to the job and should work as expected. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide106.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

The model's rig and animation works fine in Maya. To be extra sure, I also imported the model into Mixamo and added a number of animation poses to test the skin and edge flows for breakage and usability. The model worked very well across Mixamo's variety of animations. In this step the model is raising his hands above his head to reach for a crystal in the game. Following a similar pose animated in Maya, the model's structural integrity holds up to the rigours of this animation and pose. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide113.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

Similarly, the roaring animation in Mixamo works perfectly well across all 162 frames for the miner model. In this step I have used the rig from Maya that I built to simulate the animated roar and swivel motion in Mixamo to test for any disjointing in the model's torso. The integrity of the structure remains in tact despite topologising and optimising across ZBrush, Maya, and Quixel. The model is able to hold a variety of poses, including an idle-to-motion-to-idle cycle pose. With these and other documented animation tests, I am more confident of the model's performance and veracity of play within the game. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide121.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

The final model in Maya is ready, substance-painted, weight-painted, rigged, and textured. The file will be exported in both FBX and OBJ for use in Unity. During the game build, I will be in charge of the entire project and will be helping my team's programmers to use Python scripting to append the model to Unity's rigs. I will also be consulting Mixamo for animation output and ideas to drive feedback loops throughout the game. The character is complete and ready for use in a game. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/sculpting-images/Slide122.PNG "Mid-section Sculpting")

# Conclusion
The final miner character has been completed. The process began as rough paper sketches and blockouts, followed by sculpting in ZBrush. After refinements and retopologising, the figure was imported into Maya for UVs, rigging, weight painting and animation. In between, the figure was looped through the UV cycle in Quixel for texturing, then brought back into Maya for the final rig and weight painting. Once the rig was completed the figure was animated in Maya to perform a series of actions beyond what the game required. The final step was preparing the figure for export to Unity as a fully-functioning game character. 

Owing to limitations in the game however, this miner did not make it to the final game build-out. As project leader of the game's project for CW2, I will be involved in modelling and rigging the game's main character - a robot mech - and programming its movements and gameplay mechanics in Unity. However, the miner project served as a vital training bed for learning to create and animate a custom games character from scratch, using the tools learned in this course. Over the duration of this project, I have learned a number of tools - ZBrush, Maya, Quixel, Mixamo, Substance Painter - as well as numerous techniques within each software to construct and kit out a feasible games character. While more practice will always be needed, I am more confident in my abilities to build a games character and contribute to the development pipeline for games studios.
