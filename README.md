# 3D-modelling
My 3D modelling projects and progress
Hello. I’m Arjun Khara, a student at Goldsmiths College, University of London. This is my introduction to Maya and 3D modelling. As this is my first time using 3D modelling software, I will be documenting all my learnings with Maya for the purposes of the module, as well as to provide a rudimentary introduction to future students of this module who, like me, have no experience with 3D software but are eager to learn as much and as quickly as possible.

In this introduction to Maya (lesson 1 of Introduction to Modelling) I have added a doughnut and a cylinder to the scene. Using the vertex and face tools (from the right-click popup menu) I have created a mildly complex shape. In this scene I have managed to elongate the doughnut by using the extrude tool. So far this is purely experimental and playing with the tools is important, especially in a completely unfamiliar environment with such a wide plethora of tools, windows, panels, and dropdowns.

Just by switching between the tools (Q for select, W for move, E for rotate, and R for scale) and by pulling, pushing and pinching the faces, vertices, edges, and vertex points, a variety of interesting shapes can be created. Here I am trying to draw a space age piston. It’s not a very good job but this is the first time in my life that I have ever used 3D modelling software. The choice is between Maya and Blender and I have chosen Maya.

Here is the completed piston for the engine. When selecting anything in Object Mode (right mouse button over any asset will bring up the options) the asset and its wireframe components light up in a light green colour as shown in the image.

Here I have simply placed a cube onto the scene next to my piston. I figured if the only component I have is a piston then the rest of the spaceship engine is missing, in which case there must have been a crash. This method of assigning myself a story works well in creating abstract shapes since a narrative almost always puts a definite object in mind. This, I find, is the best way to approach any creative software or factured process.

In this scene I have simply pushed and pulled on vertex points and faces of the cube to create a sort of crushed and damaged look. I have also figured out how to apply a bevel effect to individual faces of the cube, which can be found under the Edit Mesh dropdown menu option. Together with Extrude (also under Edit Mesh) a variety of interesting shapes can be produced.
![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide6.PNG "Beveling and Extruding")

Here I have highlighted the vertex points by right clicking the cube and selecting Vertex from the popup menu. I am told this popup menu will be the backbone for the tools of Maya and so I am trying to get used to the presence of this menu as well as the process for calling it up – right click any object to bring up the popup menu.

In this scene I have made a deep extrusion on one side of the cube’s face. This is done by selecting an object, in this case the cube, right clicking and choosing Faces, and then extruding the face inside the cube. I then placed the piston next to the damaged piece so that the narrative speaks for itself – in this case the piston head might have fitted in the round hole in the cube at an earlier point before the crash.

More experimentation with shapes, this time with a sphere. I simply generated the sphere then applied several divisions to it by choosing Edit Mesh > Add Divisions. It is possible to drag the sphere right onto the new cube and make them appear as one. The idea is to get a feel for the pseudo 3D space in which all the assets and objects operate within. I asked about how to move objects to the back / front of each other – as is the case in Illustrator or Photoshop, but in Maya we are working in 3D space, in which case multidimensional spatial thinking is required. I believe Maya also has layers though.

I have just discovered the orthographical view, which shows the plane of perspective from four set points as shown in the image above. This is extremely handy for positioning objects and general perception since the 3D default view is not always perceived accurately. Access this view by simply hitting the space bar. When in this view, click on any of the planes of perspective and hit space bar to make that plane the default view. I suspect I will be toggling between these planes regularly.

More refinements have been done to the cube and sphere. I am trying to build a meteorite that conveys some sense of cause and effect for the crash scene. In this scene the meteorite that hit the ship’s engines landed close to the crash site.

Fortunately, the crash was next to a spare parts yard. I learned how to duplicate assets. The process is straightforward. Select an asset and make sure the mode is set to Objects. (Right Mouse Button). Then hit CTRL + D and the object is cloned. Note that the cloned object sits exactly where the original object is and so it may appear that nothing has transpired. As soon as cloning is completed, switch to the move tool (W) and move the cloned object to an empty space. Otherwise if the cloned object contains more than one asset (e.g. the sphere and cube in the previous image) it is almost impossible to select just the multiple cloned objects.

Getting familiar with the UI for faster workflow – a small but crucial step. By clicking on any of the dropdown menu options and clicking the thin double-row dots item at the very top of the dropdown menu, you can undock the menu from the window and position it anywhere on the canvas. This is extremely handy when using a menu option like Modify, Mesh, or Edit Mesh for extended periods. To get rid of these floating menus, simply click the red X at the top of the menu. Note: the floating menus do not affect the top window menu, which remains in place regardless.

Rotating around a default pivot point will not always work. Sometimes you will want to change the pivot point. You can achieve this by switching to ‘Front View’ and using shortcut F to focus, and then pressing D to bring up the pivot point crosshairs. This option allows you to move the default pivot point around which a polygon rotates, to any point of your choosing where you would like the rotation to occur. Here you can see the pivot point has been changed by dragging it down to the base of the cone. You can see from the image how the point has been moved to bottom of the polygon. The Modify menu has plenty of useful feature. One particularly useful option is Center Pivot. Use Center Pivot to return the pivot point to the default position. Alternatively, you can also use Reset Transformations but note that clicking on this option will result in your entire polygon changes being restored to default, including its position, scale, and rotation.

Freeze transformations resets the objects edit properties to zero with reference to the new origin. This is useful to prevent any accidental shifts or changes to the object, especially after fine-tuning its position in the Attribute Editor pane (right-hand side of the screen). ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide15.png "Zero Reference Objects")

When using the free transformations tool, you can further choose which edit options you would like effected – for example if you only want to edit the Translate properties but not Rotate and Scale, uncheck all the other options and keep only the Translate option checked. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide16.png "Free Transformation Tools")

If for any reason you want to return to the default options of this toolbox, simply click on Edit, then Reset Settings to re-establish the default settings that Maya configures / recommends. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide17.png "Resetting to Original Settings")

The Outliner view will quickly become a reliable friend. Apart from providing two-pane custom views of your objects, which allow you to see your assets in limited 2D and 3D perspective, the Outliner also lets you choose and rename your assets by clicking on the item in the list. This is especially useful when working on large projects where organisation and identification of assets (especially across teams) is critical for success. Here is the image reference: ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide18.png "Outliner View and Assets Management")

The Mesh tool is critical for merging, separating and reconstructing assets. In this example I have a cube. By selecting the Face option from the Right-Click Mouse Button, I can select any of the faces of the cube and delete them. To bring the deleted face back, select the Edge option from the Right-Click Mouse Button, then hold down Shift and select all four edges of the empty face, or simply double-click one edge to select all four edges of that empty face. Go to Mesh, and click Fill Hole. The cube is reconstructed. The Mesh pane describes all the options under each of its sub-section headings. Fill Hole is under the Remesh sub-section heading. Here is the image reference: ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide19.PNG "Merging and Mesh Plane Edits")

By selecting any polygon and hitting 3 on the number pad, Maya applies a smoothening effect to the polygon while maintaining the number of polygons. This is very handy to keep polygon counts low, especially for highly limited resource gaming projects. Pressing 1 on the number pad will return your polygon to its original shape. Pressing 2 on the number pad will create the same effect as pressing 3, but will retain an outline of the original polygon shape. However, note that the Mesh panel also has a smoothening option which is similar with the difference being that Mesh smoothening results in more geometry to the polygon and creates a new topology to the shape. The smoothening effect can be applied repeatedly, which will increase the polygon’s geometry by continuing to change its geometry. Here is the image reference: ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide20.png "Merging and Mesh Plane Edits")

From a regular cube to a protruding diamond. The Edit Mesh property has plenty of amendment options to regular polygons. In this example I have used the Bevel option from the Edit Mesh panel and changed the Fraction value (in the resulting pop-up) from the default 0.5 to 1. The Bevel option adds additional divisions to the polygon. Adjusting the Fraction value will increase / decrease the depth of the polygon. Adjusting the Segments value will add / remove the number of segments to the polygon. Toggling Chamfer on / off results in rounded corners to your polygon (off means straight corners, on means rounded corners). This pop-up box will be extremely handy for modelling complex shapes. To get rid of the pop-up select any polygon and hit W, E, or R. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide21.png "Merging and Mesh Plane Edits")

The image of the cube above was created in response to week 2’s challenge to explore vertices in creating smooth edges and curves for polygons without compromising polygon count. The week’s chapter explored vertices, faces, and edges and explained the importance of each in relation to the other factors that determine smooth object rendering in game engines without overloading resources. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide22.png "Merging and Mesh Plane Edits")

I tried to go beyond week 2’s requirements to create a narrative of my own development with Maya and modelling. This here is a symbol of strength and training – a reminder of the need to consistently practice with the software and keep up-to-date with the methods and best practices. The result is a dumbbell, created with two cubes that I combined using the Mesh panel. I then deleted the face of both cubes that were pointing towards each other. With the four edges of both missing faces on either cube selected, I created a bridge between the two from the Edit Mesh panel, and played with the Fraction, Twist and Segment values till I got the shape I wanted. Then I smoothened the entire structure to create this shape. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide23.png "Merging and Mesh Plane Edits")
