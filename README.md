# 3D-modelling
My 3D modelling projects and progress
Hello. I’m Arjun Khara, a student at Goldsmiths College, University of London. This is my introduction to Maya and 3D modelling. As this is my first time using 3D modelling software, I will be documenting all my learnings with Maya for the purposes of the module, as well as to provide a rudimentary introduction to future students of this module who, like me, have no experience with 3D software but are eager to learn as much and as quickly as possible.

<h1>Week 1: Maya, Familiarisation, and Simple Shapes</h1>

In this introduction to Maya (lesson 1 of Introduction to Modelling) I have added a doughnut and a cylinder to the scene. Using the vertex and face tools (from the right-click popup menu) I have created a mildly complex shape. In this scene I have managed to elongate the doughnut by using the extrude tool. So far this is purely experimental and playing with the tools is important, especially in a completely unfamiliar environment with such a wide plethora of tools, windows, panels, and dropdowns.
![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide2.PNG "Tooling Basics")

Just by switching between the tools (Q for select, W for move, E for rotate, and R for scale) and by pulling, pushing and pinching the faces, vertices, edges, and vertex points, a variety of interesting shapes can be created. Here I am trying to draw a space age piston. It’s not a very good job but this is the first time in my life that I have ever used 3D modelling software. The choice is between Maya and Blender and I have chosen Maya.
![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide3.PNG "Faces, Vertices, Edges, and Planes")

Here is the completed piston for the engine. When selecting anything in Object Mode (right mouse button over any asset will bring up the options) the asset and its wireframe components light up in a light green colour as shown in the image.
![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide4.PNG "Wireframing Components")

Here I have simply placed a cube onto the scene next to my piston. I figured if the only component I have is a piston then the rest of the spaceship engine is missing, in which case there must have been a crash. This method of assigning myself a story works well in creating abstract shapes since a narrative almost always puts a definite object in mind. This, I find, is the best way to approach any creative software or factured process.
![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide5.PNG "Adding Narratives to Scene")

In this scene I have simply pushed and pulled on vertex points and faces of the cube to create a sort of crushed and damaged look. I have also figured out how to apply a bevel effect to individual faces of the cube, which can be found under the Edit Mesh dropdown menu option. Together with Extrude (also under Edit Mesh) a variety of interesting shapes can be produced.
![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide6.PNG "Beveling and Extruding")

Here I have highlighted the vertex points by right clicking the cube and selecting Vertex from the popup menu. I am told this popup menu will be the backbone for the tools of Maya and so I am trying to get used to the presence of this menu as well as the process for calling it up – right click any object to bring up the popup menu.
![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide7.PNG "Manipulating Vertices")

In this scene I have made a deep extrusion on one side of the cube’s face. This is done by selecting an object, in this case the cube, right clicking and choosing Faces, and then extruding the face inside the cube. I then placed the piston next to the damaged piece so that the narrative speaks for itself – in this case the piston head might have fitted in the round hole in the cube at an earlier point before the crash.
![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide8.PNG "Creating Realistic Shapes")

More experimentation with shapes, this time with a sphere. I simply generated the sphere then applied several divisions to it by choosing Edit Mesh > Add Divisions. It is possible to drag the sphere right onto the new cube and make them appear as one. The idea is to get a feel for the pseudo 3D space in which all the assets and objects operate within. I asked about how to move objects to the back / front of each other – as is the case in Illustrator or Photoshop, but in Maya we are working in 3D space, in which case multidimensional spatial thinking is required. I believe Maya also has layers though.
![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide9.PNG "Adding Divisions")

I have just discovered the orthographical view, which shows the plane of perspective from four set points as shown in the image above. This is extremely handy for positioning objects and general perception since the 3D default view is not always perceived accurately. Access this view by simply hitting the space bar. When in this view, click on any of the planes of perspective and hit space bar to make that plane the default view. I suspect I will be toggling between these planes regularly. Note the importance of Maya's co-ordinate systems for manipulating objects: global (default option), local (object-oriented) and independent or arbitrary (based on user's manipulation point). Depending on what co-ordinate system is being used, the object will be manipulated accordingly. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide10.PNG "Orthographic Views")

More refinements have been done to the cube and sphere. I am trying to build a meteorite that conveys some sense of cause and effect for the crash scene. In this scene the meteorite that hit the ship’s engines landed close to the crash site.
![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide11.PNG "Refinements to Details")

Fortunately, the crash was next to a spare parts yard. I learned how to duplicate assets. The process is straightforward. Select an asset and make sure the mode is set to Objects. (Right Mouse Button). Then hit CTRL + D and the object is cloned. Note that the cloned object sits exactly where the original object is and so it may appear that nothing has transpired. As soon as cloning is completed, switch to the move tool (W) and move the cloned object to an empty space. Otherwise if the cloned object contains more than one asset (e.g. the sphere and cube in the previous image) it is almost impossible to select just the multiple cloned objects.
![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide12.PNG "Duplicating and Cloning")

Getting familiar with the UI for faster workflow – a small but crucial step. By clicking on any of the dropdown menu options and clicking the thin double-row dots item at the very top of the dropdown menu, you can undock the menu from the window and position it anywhere on the canvas. This is extremely handy when using a menu option like Modify, Mesh, or Edit Mesh for extended periods. To get rid of these floating menus, simply click the red X at the top of the menu. Note: the floating menus do not affect the top window menu, which remains in place regardless.
![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide13.PNG "Undocking Panels and Speeding Up Workflows")

Rotating around a default pivot point will not always work. Sometimes you will want to change the pivot point. You can achieve this by switching to ‘Front View’ and using shortcut F to focus, and then pressing D to bring up the pivot point crosshairs. This option allows you to move the default pivot point around which a polygon rotates, to any point of your choosing where you would like the rotation to occur. Here you can see the pivot point has been changed by dragging it down to the base of the cone. You can see from the image how the point has been moved to bottom of the polygon. The Modify menu has plenty of useful feature. One particularly useful option is Center Pivot. Use Center Pivot to return the pivot point to the default position. Alternatively, you can also use Reset Transformations but note that clicking on this option will result in your entire polygon changes being restored to default, including its position, scale, and rotation.
![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide14.png  "Rotation and Default Pivot Points")

Freeze transformations resets the objects edit properties to zero with reference to the new origin. This is useful to prevent any accidental shifts or changes to the object, especially after fine-tuning its position in the Attribute Editor pane (right-hand side of the screen). ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide15.png "Zero Reference Objects")

When using the free transformations tool, you can further choose which edit options you would like effected – for example if you only want to edit the Translate properties but not Rotate and Scale, uncheck all the other options and keep only the Translate option checked. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide16.png "Free Transformation Tools")

If for any reason you want to return to the default options of this toolbox, simply click on Edit, then Reset Settings to re-establish the default settings that Maya configures / recommends. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide17.png "Resetting to Original Settings")

The Outliner view will quickly become a reliable friend. Apart from providing two-pane custom views of your objects, which allow you to see your assets in limited 2D and 3D perspective, the Outliner also lets you choose and rename your assets by clicking on the item in the list. This is especially useful when working on large projects where organisation and identification of assets (especially across teams) is critical for success. Here is the image reference: ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide18.png "Outliner View and Assets Management")

The Mesh tool is critical for merging, separating and reconstructing assets. In this example I have a cube. By selecting the Face option from the Right-Click Mouse Button, I can select any of the faces of the cube and delete them. To bring the deleted face back, select the Edge option from the Right-Click Mouse Button, then hold down Shift and select all four edges of the empty face, or simply double-click one edge to select all four edges of that empty face. Go to Mesh, and click Fill Hole. The cube is reconstructed. The Mesh pane describes all the options under each of its sub-section headings. Fill Hole is under the Remesh sub-section heading. Here is the image reference: ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide19.PNG "Merging and Mesh Plane Edits")

<h1>Week 2: Week 1 + Complex Shapes and Morphs]</h1>

By selecting any polygon and hitting 3 on the number pad, Maya applies a smoothening effect to the polygon while maintaining the number of polygons. This is very handy to keep polygon counts low, especially for highly limited resource gaming projects. Pressing 1 on the number pad will return your polygon to its original shape. Pressing 2 on the number pad will create the same effect as pressing 3, but will retain an outline of the original polygon shape. However, note that the Mesh panel also has a smoothening option which is similar with the difference being that Mesh smoothening results in more geometry to the polygon and creates a new topology to the shape. The smoothening effect can be applied repeatedly, which will increase the polygon’s geometry by continuing to change its geometry. Here is the image reference: ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide20.png "Polygon Smootheneing Effect")

From a regular cube to a protruding diamond. The Edit Mesh property has plenty of amendment options to regular polygons. In this example I have used the Bevel option from the Edit Mesh panel and changed the Fraction value (in the resulting pop-up) from the default 0.5 to 1. The Bevel option adds additional divisions to the polygon. Adjusting the Fraction value will increase / decrease the depth of the polygon. Adjusting the Segments value will add / remove the number of segments to the polygon. Toggling Chamfer on / off results in rounded corners to your polygon (off means straight corners, on means rounded corners). This pop-up box will be extremely handy for modelling complex shapes. To get rid of the pop-up select any polygon and hit W, E, or R. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide21.png "Chamfer and Mesh Properties")

The image of the cube above was created in response to week 2’s challenge to explore vertices in creating smooth edges and curves for polygons without compromising polygon count. The week’s chapter explored vertices, faces, and edges and explained the importance of each in relation to the other factors that determine smooth object rendering in game engines without overloading resources. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide22.png "High Smootheneing with Low Poly Count")

I tried to go beyond week 2’s requirements to create a narrative of my own development with Maya and modelling. This here is a symbol of strength and training – a reminder of the need to consistently practice with the software and keep up-to-date with the methods and best practices. The result is a dumbbell, created with two cubes that I combined using the Mesh panel. I then deleted the face of both cubes that were pointing towards each other. With the four edges of both missing faces on either cube selected, I created a bridge between the two from the Edit Mesh panel, and played with the Fraction, Twist and Segment values till I got the shape I wanted. Then I smoothened the entire structure to create this shape. Note that with bridges, the number of edges selected should ideally be the same for a smooth transition. Selecting disproportional edges to bridge across assets will typically result in skewed or funky shapes, usually characterised by additional triangles, that require manual clean up. To preserve smooth workflow, ensure that the number of edges remain equal on both sides of the bridge. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide23.png "Complex Dumbell From Simple Cube")

Still just experimenting with the tools learned so far, I decided to create a simple concept of a variable dumbbell weight which can be filled with sand or water (materials I would like to explore later and which are essential to level design) I toggled to the Faces option from the Right Mouse Button, and selected the two faces you see here hovering above the dumbbell. Then from Edit Mesh I selected the Detach option and simply lifted the two faces off the rest of the polygon, by switching to the move option, W. The dumbbell now has a deeper narrative owing to the juxtaposition of weight and strength versus hollowness and intrigue. By manipulating a few faces, edges, vertices, and options from the Edit Mesh panel, Maya can provide a lot of inspiration for narratives, story concepts, and maybe ultimately even a fresh idea for the next game. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide24.png "Detached Faces")

The Extrude option under Edit Mesh will be a vital tool for modelling interesting and whacky objects. Here I have used the Extrude tool (in precisely the same order as the Detach tool from the example prior to this) to give extra body and dimensions to the dumbbell and the raised faces. The voluminous look creates some added appeal – perhaps the building blocks for a spaceship scene. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide25.png "Extruding Faces in Complex Shapes")

Using a combination of tools from the Edit Mesh panel I created a warp engine concept with an extendable recharging boom and a damaged transducer. The complexity of shapes is manageable using the History pane. Further refinements are possible as the toolsets for Maya become more familiar. Again, keep experimenting with the polygons and their controls. A good tip is to keep building off from the beginning then launching one step further. For example start with step 1. Then do step 1 and step 2. Then repeat step 1 and step 2 and add step 3. Then repeat steps 1, 2, and 3 and add step 4. This layered style learning loops your hands-on experience and reinforces memory of previously learned concepts and controls. Also, always balance concepts with control. Don’t let either the tools or the ideas get ahead of each other. Keeping them both in check will result in a smoother project flow. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide26.png "Extruding Faces in Complex Shapes")

And so the repertoire of assets, objects and creativity grows. At this stage I have tried to challenge myself to begin creating assets that emulate a bit more of real life rather than let my imagination reign without guides. Giving myself a concrete example or object to create, in this case pistons and serrated ball bearings, provided greater guidance and more discipline in approaching 3D modelling. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide27.png "Getting Inspiration from Real World Objects")

My first mock-up of a Vector C-Class (Aggressive) Destroyer, complete with circular divisions, bevels, collapse, connect, vertices, segments, and divisions to create a more complex model than in previous attempts. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide28.png "Learned Circularisation With Geometry")

In this workflow I have concentrated only on the Extrude option in the Edit Mesh panel. I first selected the entire cube as normal (so that the entire polygon was light brown) then clicked Extrude. Through some research and trial and error I found that in the polyExtrude pop-up window that appears, the Keep Faces Together option needs to be turned off in this example. Once that’s done the little boxes and planes near the XYZ direction arrows can be used to manipulate the sections of the box. Clicking Extrude again will create a smaller cube within the larger cube. In this example I extruded three times to create this crate / carton model. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide29.png "Multiple Extrusion Processes Across Planes")

Another important shape in modelling – the 3D triangle / pyramid / trapezoidal shapes required for everything from roofing in the Sims to ramps in Motor X. I started out by creating a cube as normal. Then I switched to Vertex mode and selected two adjacent vertices and used the Merge option from the Edit Mesh panel. I repeated the process for two more adjacent vertices and the result was this shape. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide30.png "Vertex Manipulation")

The Delete Edge / Vertex option in the Edit Mesh panel removes any edges and their corresponding vertices – a handy tool when working with specific polygon shapes and edges where vertex count is a factor. It is of course also extremely useful in further refining the polygon as I discovered with further experimentation. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide31.png "Detaches and Extrusions")

Once Delete Edge / Vertex has been applied, experiment with the Detach option in the Edit Mesh panel. By removing the border of the top face of the cube, then applying Extrude to the sides, I was able to create this bathtub / rollercoaster cubicle / fancy shoe etc. Modelling with polygons means having a particular form and function in mind, then getting familiar with the tools to build this out, since there are multiple avenues to reach the same final result. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide32.png "Advanced Shapes from Toolsets")

In this instance I have modified the bathtub from the previous exercise. Using the same tools learned so far, it is possible to now start creating very rudimentary character structures, like this rodent with an ear, eye socket and mouth. Further refinement will result in a more detailed and realistic outcome but the process has already begun at this stage. The key is to keep experimenting to achieve the eventual desired outcome. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide33.png "Restructuring Current Shapes")

The Mesh Tools panel has some incredibly useful options, of which not least is the Insert Edge Loop option. By clicking on this tool, Maya creates additional edges or segments across the vertical and horizontal planes of the polygon. The applications to efficient modelling cannot be overemphasised. The Insert Edge Tool option has additional features in the Tool Settings pane. For example, clicking Multiple Edge Loops will create a set number of equidistant edges to the cube. You specify how many edges you want in the value box below. Once that is done, clicking on the Reset Tool button towards the top of the Tool Settings pane will allow for each edge to be individually manipulated. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide34.png "Mesh and Insert Edge Tools")

Game design requires a strict control over the number of polygons, vertices, faces, and edges to maximise the efficient use of resources. Maya provides a handy feature to keep track of these. Navigate to the top row of menu items and click on Display. From the dropdown menu navigate to the Heads Up Display sub-menu item, then down to the Poly Count checkbox. The menu items in Maya are typically in alphabetical order. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide35.png "Polycount Management")

Continuing towards an ultimate concept, the all-important cannon is an essential component of any action-based story. This cannon was created by placing a cube polygon, inserting edge loops to get the desired shape, then extruding a face to form a protrusion. I then bevelled the leading face of the protrusion and extruded the resulting face back into the structure to create the hollowed-out cannon effect. Further refinement will continue as the module and this project progresses. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide36.png "Essential Games Cannon")

This cannon has quite literally been knocked out from the top and dented on the sides to show it is now out of action. This effect is once again the result of combining all the tools learned so far. I've learned how to model and assign knockouts and incongruent destruction properties and patterns for games assets. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide37.png "Knockouts and Destruction Patterns")

<h1>Week 3: Weeks 1, 2 + Complex Forms, Shaders, and UV</h1>

The concept is to build a robot that is also symbolic of a common practice, in this case a light-hearted jab at toilet humour. The T-Bot 2 Series will hopefully be a convincing enough metaphor for this concept. The first part of the robot – the articulated shoulder and sprocket joint, elbow, arm, and pivot-swing support – have been modelled to resemble the mechanism found within cisterns including the handle, support strut and pump. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide38.png "Conjoined Models with Articulation")

The joint of the reticulated arm created by first extending the length of the arm (in Vertex mode), then inserting an edge loop (Shift + Right Mouse Button; then select Insert Edge Loop) and pushing the edge back to create an elbow. Then extend the forearm vertices and taper using the scale tool. Finally add a sphere and deform its shape into that of an egg and attaching it to the elbow joint. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide39.png "Reticulation Modelling")

I added detail to the spherical joint by selecting faces on the sphere, circularize the selected faces, then begin extruding them inwards towards the joint, to create a suitable depression. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide40.png "Spherical Joints for Robotic Arm")

Arms have been mirrored by duplicating the original (left) assembly and reversing the scale in the Channel Box / Layer Editor pane. The body has been constructed from a cube with edge loops, warped vertices, and smoothening applied. Additional details and dents have been applied through a combination of tools under the Mesh, Edit Mesh, and Mesh Tools panes. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide41.png "Mirroring for Robot Body and Arms")

Likewise, the back of the robot has been provided with a similar anatomy to the front – the indentations at the front provide a consistent ripple effect throughout the back, creating the illusion of a bullet or projectile that has passed through the torso and has resulted in its shape, which is consequently not to mechanical or biological, but somewhere in between; a bionic construct. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide42.png "Backface and Frontface Anatomy")

Leg joints created and attached to the bottom section of the torso. For symmetry accuracy all assets were grouped accordingly (CTRL + G) then positioned by inserting values into the Channel Editor / Layer Settings numeric boxes to mirror each asset’s counter position. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide43.png "Torso and Hip Joints")

Through a few (actually many) YouTube tutorials I have (to some extent) figured out the bend deformer tool and its application to making assets like pipes, hoses, wiring etc. No toilet concept is complete without plumbing and the exercise to find, create and manipulate pipes will no doubt be a useful skill to learn for future modelling projects. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide44.png "Curves for Pipes and Hoses")

Toilet Robot (T-Bot 2 Series) model – replete with hose and air filter funnel – getting close to completion. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide45.png "Basic Robot Form")

The main torso has been modelled to look like the portable toilets one finds at construction sites and large public gatherings. The extra allusions have been added by way of the squatting posture, freed up arms for reading, and the coin slot at the back – all of which (hopefully) render the concept of the daily visit. A few future additions might include allusions to a magazine rack holder and a drain-like shape for increased association. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide46.png "Posture and Poise")

Additional textures have been added to the toilet robot, along the lines of the “Toilet Zone” look and feel. Here I have learned to apply nodes and chamfer vertices to create a more textured and asymmetrical look. Using the hypershade tool I have also managed to vary the vertex spacing and extrude depths to create imbalanced albedo levels across the model, which I believe will be useful for when I ultimately do a UV wrap and texture. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide47.png "Texture and Topology")

Further detailing done to the body of the model to create a diseased and leprosy-inducing look. This effect is achieved by chamfering individual faces and extruding / deforming each face to create the pimply, diseased-growth look. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide48.png "Deform Tools")

Further improvements to the robot were done here by isolating specific sections of the body and manipulating them through the basic command tools (bevel, extrude, bridge etc) and through the mirror tool where symmetry is required. The mirror tool was used to mirror along the objects mode rather than the world mode, since the robot’s position and construct is ever so slightly asymmetrical. Further refinements have been carried out to the front façade to increase the derelict quality of the robot and the scene it will operate in. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide49.png "Combination of Tools for Modelling Facade")

With the toilet bot nearing completion, the environment around it is under construction, in this case a modern water closet, complete with counter, sink, faucets, mugs, shelves, and towel rack. The robot standing to the side is in fact the cistern, which hopefully adds to the narrative tension of this scene. The walls, fixtures, and fittings for the structure were built using grid snaps, live interaction, and the list of common tools. I have also changed the background from flat grey to the default gradient since the scene is moving from a flat two-dimensional plane to a more three-dimensional construct. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide50.png "Environment Construction")

The colouring process with shaders – so far I have managed to apply blinn, phong, and materials and anisotropic shaders to the walls and fittings. The robot will come later. The shaders can be found under the Rendering shelf of the top toolbar in Maya. It is important to use the Outliner pane (left of the screen) to properly label all assets since the more shaders and details in a scene the more complex is the workflow and process management. After this stage will come Arnold. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide51.png "Shader Applications")

To copy-paste an existing object’s shader to apply to another object, right click the object that requires shading. From the corresponding dropdown menu, locate the Assign Existing Material option, and from the flyout tab choose the shader that has already been applied to the first object, for use on the latter. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide52.png "Shader Toolbars")

After finding a suitable image of a texture online, and importing it into Maya (in this case the flooring, which initially had a blinn applied to it, but after clicking on the checker box icon near the blinn, an image can be uploaded to Maya) the flooring is ready for UV wrapping / unwrapping. The thumbnail of the red and white carpet texture can be seen in the image above. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide53.png "Texture Mapping")

This is in UV editing mode (from the dropdown menu at the extreme top-right corner). Select UV Editing from the dropdown. The layout here shows the file that has been imported with corresponding UV values from 0 to 1. This UV Editing layout screen can also be reached from Windows > Modelling Editors > UV Editing. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide54.png "UV Mapping")

Here is the carpet texture that was imported from the last step. The texture can be brought up by clicking on the face / surface / object that the texture was uploaded and assigned to, from the previous step. The white inverted T is the UV wrapper, which is in fact the six sides of a completely wrapped cube. Note: the UV is a flattened-out version of the object that needs to be wrapped along a box model. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide55.png "Flattening Maps")

Clicking on the checker map button (the two buttons in line with the right of the UV box in image above) will bring up the UV checker screen with corresponding coordinates and values. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide56.png "UV Co-ordinate Values")

Of the six empty spaces in the inverted T, one of them contains the texture. To see which one, right-click the asset from the screen on the left (in this case the floor) and the UV layout on the right will highlight (in green) which space contains the texture. In almost all cases it is the third box from the top just before the horizontal bar of the T. If for any reason the texture is not showing up, as is the case here, click on the scene on the left, then press 6 on the number pad to bring up the texture view. Note that assigning the texture in this mode will do a complete UV wrap of the object. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide57.png "UV T-bar Mapping")

Assign a new UV by clicking on UV (from the top menu) then select planar in this case since the surface is flat. Consider the shape of the asset before assigning a cylindrical, spherical or planar UV. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide58.png "Assigning New UVs")

Selecting planar has assigned a brand new set of UVs to the flooring of this scene. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide59.png "Planar View")

Success! The carpet texture has been applied to the floor as a UV. In the next step I will download a painting to map onto a frame on the left wall, following the same procedure described above. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide60.png "UV Map Completed")

Here is a painting UV wrapped onto the face of simple cube that has been reshaped to become a frame. UV wrapping requires creating a new set of UVs to fit with the inverted T as described. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide61.png "UV Map of Painting")

The scene is coming along nicely now that UV wrapping has been added. In the following sections I will be adding shaders, textures, and UV wraps to the robot, which will likely be the most detailed (and rewarding in many ways) work of this project. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide62.png "UV Map of Environment")

In this scene I have added a proper carpet texture through the UV wrap tool and also created a wicker basket for added practice with UV tools, following the same procedure learned so far. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide63.png "UV Map of Wicker Basket")

<h1>Week 4: Weeks 1, 2, 3 + Full Scenes, Arnold, and Rendering</h1>

THE ROOM: Here is a new scene I am creating, from scratch, to apply everything learned so far. I have subscribed to a few tutorials on YouTube as well as Udemy (which is more structured) that teaches the basics of shading and UV wrapping using Maya 2017. I am using Maya 2018, but the tools are largely similar. I will be creating a low poly scene. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide64.PNG "Modeling a Room")

I have built the furniture in this office scene (chair, desk, laptop, mugs, books, picture frame, window, and whiteboard) using the techniques described in this document. I then applied a lambert shader to the two walls and set the colour. Shelf and desk with shaders (lambert, blinn, and phong) applied. Floor shader (blinn) applied with reflectivity added for rendering and lighting effects, which will follow in the next few steps. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide65.PNG "Shaders Applied")

Multiple shaders applied to different faces of the same object. The vertices, faces, and edges can all be manipulated individually for any action being carried out, from applying shaders to UV wrapping. I have even managed to allocate shaders to the window panels for added effect.![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide66.PNG "Lambert Values")

Shaders applied to all objects, including individual book pages, which carry the same lambert values, whereas the covers for each possess varying blinn shaders. The next few steps will be UV mapping, followed by lighting, then rendering using Maya’s inbuilt render as well as the Arnold rendering engine. Tip: to apply the same shader to other objects, right click on the object that requires shading, then holding down the right mouse button scroll down the menu to the Assign Existing Material option. From the flyout menu pick one of the shaders that has been already been applied. Throughout this process do not release the right mouse button. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide67.PNG "UV Wrapped Picture")

A UV wrap has been assigned to the picture hanging on the wall, in this case an image of Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. The UV wrap is done by first uploading an image to the sourceimage.exe file as this is where Maya looks for files. Then go to the UV Editing option from the dropdown menu on the top right. Identify the box from the inverted T which contains the face that will hold the image and assign the UV wrap. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide68.PNG "Phong Shaders")

 Window with see-through glass added using a phong shader with transparency. I played around with the sliders and settings. Maya does a good job generating the effects in real time. In this scene the glass has almost maximum transparency with moderate levels of reflectivity, specular colour and reflected colour applied. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide69.PNG "Transparency Settings")

Once the basic modelling is complete it is time to render. I have set up a camera by going to Create > Cameras > Camera. This generates a camera within the scene. Position the camera then go to the Panels option in the dedicated window bar and choose ‘Look Through Selected’. The scene is now being viewed through the camera that has just been created. Also click on the little icon that says Resolution Gate to view what the final output will look like, and what dimensions, in this case 960 by 540. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide70.PNG "Camera and Render Settings")

Choosing the camera’s Focal Length can alter the perception of the scene. In this example I played around with the values to find the best composition for this scene. To get to this window, click on ‘camera’ in the Outliner panel to the left, and make sure the Attribute Editor is active in the right panel. Tip: to avoid accidentally shifting the perspective and reconfiguring it, lock the camera’s settings by clicking on the little icon with the camera and lock symbol, located at the top of the dedicated window, under the View, Shading, Lighting, Show, Renderer, Panels bar. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide71.PNG "Camera Focal Length")

In this scene I have created a light (the first step towards final rendering) by going to Create > Lights > Point Light. Just like a polygon object, the light asset will be generated in the scene. View the effects of the lighting by clicking on the little icon with the bulb symbol, located at the top of the dedicated window, under the View, Shading, Lighting, Show, Renderer, Panels bar. Using the now familiar move / rotate / scale tools the light can be positioned and adjusted as required. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide72.PNG "Lighting a Scene")

View the shadows generated by the point light by clicking on the little icon with the sphere and shadow symbol, located at the top of the dedicated window, under the View, Shading, Lighting, Show, Renderer, Panels bar. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide73.PNG "Shadows and Casts")

In this example I have removed the point light and placed a spotlight with tweaked values for the cone angle, penumbra angle, drop off and shadows – all of which can be found in the Attribute Editor panel on the right. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide74.PNG "Tweaking Light Settings")

I have now started using Arnold lighting systems. In this case I have used the area lighting option from the Arnold top menu dropdown. This is the Arnold render window, which can be reached by clicking on the little icon with the scene clapper and eye in front of it, located just below the top menu of Maya. Each light can be hidden and shown separately to see individual effects by choosing the light in the Outliner panel and toggling the light on and off by using the H key. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide75.PNG "Arnold Light Settings")
