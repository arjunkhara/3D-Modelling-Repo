# 3D-modelling
My 3D modelling projects and progress
Hello. I’m Arjun Khara, a student at Goldsmiths College, University of London. This is my introduction to Maya and 3D modelling. As this is my first time using 3D modelling software, I will be documenting all my learnings with Maya for the purposes of the module, as well as to provide a rudimentary introduction to future students of this module who, like me, have no experience with 3D software but are eager to learn as much and as quickly as possible.

In this introduction to Maya (lesson 1 of Introduction to Modelling) I have added a doughnut and a cylinder to the scene. Using the vertex and face tools (from the right-click popup menu) I have created a mildly complex shape. In this scene I have managed to elongate the doughnut by using the extrude tool. So far this is purely experimental and playing with the tools is important, especially in a completely unfamiliar environment with such a wide plethora of tools, windows, panels, and dropdowns.

Just by switching between the tools (Q for select, W for move, E for rotate, and R for scale) and by pulling, pushing and pinching the faces, vertices, edges, and vertex points, a variety of interesting shapes can be created. Here I am trying to draw a space age piston. It’s not a very good job but this is the first time in my life that I have ever used 3D modelling software. The choice is between Maya and Blender and I have chosen Maya.

Here is the completed piston for the engine. When selecting anything in Object Mode (right mouse button over any asset will bring up the options) the asset and its wireframe components light up in a light green colour as shown in the image.

Here I have simply placed a cube onto the scene next to my piston. I figured if the only component I have is a piston then the rest of the spaceship engine is missing, in which case there must have been a crash. This method of assigning myself a story works well in creating abstract shapes since a narrative almost always puts a definite object in mind. This, I find, is the best way to approach any creative software or factured process.

In this scene I have simply pushed and pulled on vertex points and faces of the cube to create a sort of crushed and damaged look. I have also figured out how to apply a bevel effect to individual faces of the cube, which can be found under the Edit Mesh dropdown menu option. Together with Extrude (also under Edit Mesh) a variety of interesting shapes can be produced.
