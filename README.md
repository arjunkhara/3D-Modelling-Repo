# 3D-modelling
My 3D modelling projects and progress
Hello. Iâ€™m Arjun Khara, a student at Goldsmiths College, University of London. This is my introduction to Maya and 3D modelling. As this is my first time using 3D modelling software, I will be documenting all my learnings with Maya for the purposes of the module, as well as to provide a rudimentary introduction to future students of this module who, like me, have no experience with 3D software but are eager to learn as much and as quickly as possible.

In this introduction to Maya (lesson 1 of Introduction to Modelling) I have added a doughnut and a cylinder to the scene. Using the vertex and face tools (from the right-click popup menu) I have created a mildly complex shape. In this scene I have managed to elongate the doughnut by using the extrude tool. So far this is purely experimental and playing with the tools is important, especially in a completely unfamiliar environment with such a wide plethora of tools, windows, panels, and dropdowns.
