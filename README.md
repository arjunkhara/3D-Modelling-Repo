# 3D-modelling
My 3D modelling projects and progress
Hello. I’m Arjun Khara, a student at Goldsmiths College, University of London. This is my introduction to Maya and 3D modelling. As this is my first time using 3D modelling software, I will be documenting all my learnings with Maya for the purposes of the module, as well as to provide a rudimentary introduction to future students of this module who, like me, have no experience with 3D software but are eager to learn as much and as quickly as possible.

<h1>Week 1: Maya, Familiarisation, and Simple Shapes</h1>

In this introduction to Maya (lesson 1 of Introduction to Modelling) I have added a doughnut and a cylinder to the scene. Using the vertex and face tools (from the right-click popup menu) I have created a mildly complex shape. In this scene I have managed to elongate the doughnut by using the extrude tool. So far this is purely experimental and playing with the tools is important, especially in a completely unfamiliar environment with such a wide plethora of tools, windows, panels, and dropdowns.
![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide2.PNG "Tooling Basics")

Just by switching between the tools (Q for select, W for move, E for rotate, and R for scale) and by pulling, pushing and pinching the faces, vertices, edges, and vertex points, a variety of interesting shapes can be created. Here I am trying to draw a space age piston. It’s not a very good job but this is the first time in my life that I have ever used 3D modelling software. The choice is between Maya and Blender and I have chosen Maya.
![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide3.PNG "Faces, Vertices, Edges, and Planes")

Here is the completed piston for the engine. When selecting anything in Object Mode (right mouse button over any asset will bring up the options) the asset and its wireframe components light up in a light green colour as shown in the image.
![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide4.PNG "Wireframing Components")

Here I have simply placed a cube onto the scene next to my piston. I figured if the only component I have is a piston then the rest of the spaceship engine is missing, in which case there must have been a crash. This method of assigning myself a story works well in creating abstract shapes since a narrative almost always puts a definite object in mind. This, I find, is the best way to approach any creative software or factured process.
![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide5.PNG "Adding Narratives to Scene")

In this scene I have simply pushed and pulled on vertex points and faces of the cube to create a sort of crushed and damaged look. I have also figured out how to apply a bevel effect to individual faces of the cube, which can be found under the Edit Mesh dropdown menu option. Together with Extrude (also under Edit Mesh) a variety of interesting shapes can be produced.
![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide6.PNG "Beveling and Extruding")

Here I have highlighted the vertex points by right clicking the cube and selecting Vertex from the popup menu. I am told this popup menu will be the backbone for the tools of Maya and so I am trying to get used to the presence of this menu as well as the process for calling it up – right click any object to bring up the popup menu.
![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide7.PNG "Manipulating Vertices")

In this scene I have made a deep extrusion on one side of the cube’s face. This is done by selecting an object, in this case the cube, right clicking and choosing Faces, and then extruding the face inside the cube. I then placed the piston next to the damaged piece so that the narrative speaks for itself – in this case the piston head might have fitted in the round hole in the cube at an earlier point before the crash.
![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide8.PNG "Creating Realistic Shapes")

More experimentation with shapes, this time with a sphere. I simply generated the sphere then applied several divisions to it by choosing Edit Mesh > Add Divisions. It is possible to drag the sphere right onto the new cube and make them appear as one. The idea is to get a feel for the pseudo 3D space in which all the assets and objects operate within. I asked about how to move objects to the back / front of each other – as is the case in Illustrator or Photoshop, but in Maya we are working in 3D space, in which case multidimensional spatial thinking is required. I believe Maya also has layers though.
![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide9.PNG "Adding Divisions")

I have just discovered the orthographical view, which shows the plane of perspective from four set points as shown in the image above. This is extremely handy for positioning objects and general perception since the 3D default view is not always perceived accurately. Access this view by simply hitting the space bar. When in this view, click on any of the planes of perspective and hit space bar to make that plane the default view. I suspect I will be toggling between these planes regularly. Note the importance of Maya's co-ordinate systems for manipulating objects: global (default option), local (object-oriented) and independent or arbitrary (based on user's manipulation point). Depending on what co-ordinate system is being used, the object will be manipulated accordingly. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide10.PNG "Orthographic Views")

More refinements have been done to the cube and sphere. I am trying to build a meteorite that conveys some sense of cause and effect for the crash scene. In this scene the meteorite that hit the ship’s engines landed close to the crash site.
![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide11.PNG "Refinements to Details")

Fortunately, the crash was next to a spare parts yard. I learned how to duplicate assets. The process is straightforward. Select an asset and make sure the mode is set to Objects. (Right Mouse Button). Then hit CTRL + D and the object is cloned. Note that the cloned object sits exactly where the original object is and so it may appear that nothing has transpired. As soon as cloning is completed, switch to the move tool (W) and move the cloned object to an empty space. Otherwise if the cloned object contains more than one asset (e.g. the sphere and cube in the previous image) it is almost impossible to select just the multiple cloned objects.
![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide12.PNG "Duplicating and Cloning")

Getting familiar with the UI for faster workflow – a small but crucial step. By clicking on any of the dropdown menu options and clicking the thin double-row dots item at the very top of the dropdown menu, you can undock the menu from the window and position it anywhere on the canvas. This is extremely handy when using a menu option like Modify, Mesh, or Edit Mesh for extended periods. To get rid of these floating menus, simply click the red X at the top of the menu. Note: the floating menus do not affect the top window menu, which remains in place regardless.
![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide13.PNG "Undocking Panels and Speeding Up Workflows")

Rotating around a default pivot point will not always work. Sometimes you will want to change the pivot point. You can achieve this by switching to ‘Front View’ and using shortcut F to focus, and then pressing D to bring up the pivot point crosshairs. This option allows you to move the default pivot point around which a polygon rotates, to any point of your choosing where you would like the rotation to occur. Here you can see the pivot point has been changed by dragging it down to the base of the cone. You can see from the image how the point has been moved to bottom of the polygon. The Modify menu has plenty of useful feature. One particularly useful option is Center Pivot. Use Center Pivot to return the pivot point to the default position. Alternatively, you can also use Reset Transformations but note that clicking on this option will result in your entire polygon changes being restored to default, including its position, scale, and rotation.
![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide14.png  "Rotation and Default Pivot Points")

Freeze transformations resets the objects edit properties to zero with reference to the new origin. This is useful to prevent any accidental shifts or changes to the object, especially after fine-tuning its position in the Attribute Editor pane (right-hand side of the screen). ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide15.png "Zero Reference Objects")

When using the free transformations tool, you can further choose which edit options you would like effected – for example if you only want to edit the Translate properties but not Rotate and Scale, uncheck all the other options and keep only the Translate option checked. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide16.png "Free Transformation Tools")

If for any reason you want to return to the default options of this toolbox, simply click on Edit, then Reset Settings to re-establish the default settings that Maya configures / recommends. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide17.png "Resetting to Original Settings")

The Outliner view will quickly become a reliable friend. Apart from providing two-pane custom views of your objects, which allow you to see your assets in limited 2D and 3D perspective, the Outliner also lets you choose and rename your assets by clicking on the item in the list. This is especially useful when working on large projects where organisation and identification of assets (especially across teams) is critical for success. Here is the image reference: ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide18.png "Outliner View and Assets Management")

The Mesh tool is critical for merging, separating and reconstructing assets. In this example I have a cube. By selecting the Face option from the Right-Click Mouse Button, I can select any of the faces of the cube and delete them. To bring the deleted face back, select the Edge option from the Right-Click Mouse Button, then hold down Shift and select all four edges of the empty face, or simply double-click one edge to select all four edges of that empty face. Go to Mesh, and click Fill Hole. The cube is reconstructed. The Mesh pane describes all the options under each of its sub-section headings. Fill Hole is under the Remesh sub-section heading. Here is the image reference: ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide19.PNG "Merging and Mesh Plane Edits")

<h1>Week 2: Week 1 + Complex Shapes and Morphs]</h1>

By selecting any polygon and hitting 3 on the number pad, Maya applies a smoothening effect to the polygon while maintaining the number of polygons. This is very handy to keep polygon counts low, especially for highly limited resource gaming projects. Pressing 1 on the number pad will return your polygon to its original shape. Pressing 2 on the number pad will create the same effect as pressing 3, but will retain an outline of the original polygon shape. However, note that the Mesh panel also has a smoothening option which is similar with the difference being that Mesh smoothening results in more geometry to the polygon and creates a new topology to the shape. The smoothening effect can be applied repeatedly, which will increase the polygon’s geometry by continuing to change its geometry. Here is the image reference: ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide20.png "Polygon Smootheneing Effect")

From a regular cube to a protruding diamond. The Edit Mesh property has plenty of amendment options to regular polygons. In this example I have used the Bevel option from the Edit Mesh panel and changed the Fraction value (in the resulting pop-up) from the default 0.5 to 1. The Bevel option adds additional divisions to the polygon. Adjusting the Fraction value will increase / decrease the depth of the polygon. Adjusting the Segments value will add / remove the number of segments to the polygon. Toggling Chamfer on / off results in rounded corners to your polygon (off means straight corners, on means rounded corners). This pop-up box will be extremely handy for modelling complex shapes. To get rid of the pop-up select any polygon and hit W, E, or R. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide21.png "Chamfer and Mesh Properties")

The image of the cube above was created in response to week 2’s challenge to explore vertices in creating smooth edges and curves for polygons without compromising polygon count. The week’s chapter explored vertices, faces, and edges and explained the importance of each in relation to the other factors that determine smooth object rendering in game engines without overloading resources. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide22.png "High Smootheneing with Low Poly Count")

I tried to go beyond week 2’s requirements to create a narrative of my own development with Maya and modelling. This here is a symbol of strength and training – a reminder of the need to consistently practice with the software and keep up-to-date with the methods and best practices. The result is a dumbbell, created with two cubes that I combined using the Mesh panel. I then deleted the face of both cubes that were pointing towards each other. With the four edges of both missing faces on either cube selected, I created a bridge between the two from the Edit Mesh panel, and played with the Fraction, Twist and Segment values till I got the shape I wanted. Then I smoothened the entire structure to create this shape. Note that with bridges, the number of edges selected should ideally be the same for a smooth transition. Selecting disproportional edges to bridge across assets will typically result in skewed or funky shapes, usually characterised by additional triangles, that require manual clean up. To preserve smooth workflow, ensure that the number of edges remain equal on both sides of the bridge. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide23.png "Complex Dumbell From Simple Cube")

Still just experimenting with the tools learned so far, I decided to create a simple concept of a variable dumbbell weight which can be filled with sand or water (materials I would like to explore later and which are essential to level design) I toggled to the Faces option from the Right Mouse Button, and selected the two faces you see here hovering above the dumbbell. Then from Edit Mesh I selected the Detach option and simply lifted the two faces off the rest of the polygon, by switching to the move option, W. The dumbbell now has a deeper narrative owing to the juxtaposition of weight and strength versus hollowness and intrigue. By manipulating a few faces, edges, vertices, and options from the Edit Mesh panel, Maya can provide a lot of inspiration for narratives, story concepts, and maybe ultimately even a fresh idea for the next game. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide24.png "Detached Faces")

The Extrude option under Edit Mesh will be a vital tool for modelling interesting and whacky objects. Here I have used the Extrude tool (in precisely the same order as the Detach tool from the example prior to this) to give extra body and dimensions to the dumbbell and the raised faces. The voluminous look creates some added appeal – perhaps the building blocks for a spaceship scene. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide25.png "Extruding Faces in Complex Shapes")

Using a combination of tools from the Edit Mesh panel I created a warp engine concept with an extendable recharging boom and a damaged transducer. The complexity of shapes is manageable using the History pane. Further refinements are possible as the toolsets for Maya become more familiar. Again, keep experimenting with the polygons and their controls. A good tip is to keep building off from the beginning then launching one step further. For example start with step 1. Then do step 1 and step 2. Then repeat step 1 and step 2 and add step 3. Then repeat steps 1, 2, and 3 and add step 4. This layered style learning loops your hands-on experience and reinforces memory of previously learned concepts and controls. Also, always balance concepts with control. Don’t let either the tools or the ideas get ahead of each other. Keeping them both in check will result in a smoother project flow. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide26.png "Extruding Faces in Complex Shapes")

And so the repertoire of assets, objects and creativity grows. At this stage I have tried to challenge myself to begin creating assets that emulate a bit more of real life rather than let my imagination reign without guides. Giving myself a concrete example or object to create, in this case pistons and serrated ball bearings, provided greater guidance and more discipline in approaching 3D modelling. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide27.png "Getting Inspiration from Real World Objects")

My first mock-up of a Vector C-Class (Aggressive) Destroyer, complete with circular divisions, bevels, collapse, connect, vertices, segments, and divisions to create a more complex model than in previous attempts. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide28.png "Learned Circularisation With Geometry")

In this workflow I have concentrated only on the Extrude option in the Edit Mesh panel. I first selected the entire cube as normal (so that the entire polygon was light brown) then clicked Extrude. Through some research and trial and error I found that in the polyExtrude pop-up window that appears, the Keep Faces Together option needs to be turned off in this example. Once that’s done the little boxes and planes near the XYZ direction arrows can be used to manipulate the sections of the box. Clicking Extrude again will create a smaller cube within the larger cube. In this example I extruded three times to create this crate / carton model. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide29.png "Multiple Extrusion Processes Across Planes")

Another important shape in modelling – the 3D triangle / pyramid / trapezoidal shapes required for everything from roofing in the Sims to ramps in Motor X. I started out by creating a cube as normal. Then I switched to Vertex mode and selected two adjacent vertices and used the Merge option from the Edit Mesh panel. I repeated the process for two more adjacent vertices and the result was this shape. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide30.png "Vertex Manipulation")

The Delete Edge / Vertex option in the Edit Mesh panel removes any edges and their corresponding vertices – a handy tool when working with specific polygon shapes and edges where vertex count is a factor. It is of course also extremely useful in further refining the polygon as I discovered with further experimentation. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide31.png "Detaches and Extrusions")

Once Delete Edge / Vertex has been applied, experiment with the Detach option in the Edit Mesh panel. By removing the border of the top face of the cube, then applying Extrude to the sides, I was able to create this bathtub / rollercoaster cubicle / fancy shoe etc. Modelling with polygons means having a particular form and function in mind, then getting familiar with the tools to build this out, since there are multiple avenues to reach the same final result. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide32.png "Advanced Shapes from Toolsets")

In this instance I have modified the bathtub from the previous exercise. Using the same tools learned so far, it is possible to now start creating very rudimentary character structures, like this rodent with an ear, eye socket and mouth. Further refinement will result in a more detailed and realistic outcome but the process has already begun at this stage. The key is to keep experimenting to achieve the eventual desired outcome. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide33.png "Restructuring Current Shapes")

The Mesh Tools panel has some incredibly useful options, of which not least is the Insert Edge Loop option. By clicking on this tool, Maya creates additional edges or segments across the vertical and horizontal planes of the polygon. The applications to efficient modelling cannot be overemphasised. The Insert Edge Tool option has additional features in the Tool Settings pane. For example, clicking Multiple Edge Loops will create a set number of equidistant edges to the cube. You specify how many edges you want in the value box below. Once that is done, clicking on the Reset Tool button towards the top of the Tool Settings pane will allow for each edge to be individually manipulated. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide34.png "Mesh and Insert Edge Tools")

Game design requires a strict control over the number of polygons, vertices, faces, and edges to maximise the efficient use of resources. Maya provides a handy feature to keep track of these. Navigate to the top row of menu items and click on Display. From the dropdown menu navigate to the Heads Up Display sub-menu item, then down to the Poly Count checkbox. The menu items in Maya are typically in alphabetical order. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide35.png "Polycount Management")

Continuing towards an ultimate concept, the all-important cannon is an essential component of any action-based story. This cannon was created by placing a cube polygon, inserting edge loops to get the desired shape, then extruding a face to form a protrusion. I then bevelled the leading face of the protrusion and extruded the resulting face back into the structure to create the hollowed-out cannon effect. Further refinement will continue as the module and this project progresses. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide36.png "Essential Games Cannon")

This cannon has quite literally been knocked out from the top and dented on the sides to show it is now out of action. This effect is once again the result of combining all the tools learned so far. I've learned how to model and assign knockouts and incongruent destruction properties and patterns for games assets. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide37.png "Knockouts and Destruction Patterns")

<h1>Week 3: Weeks 1, 2 + Complex Forms, Shaders, and UV</h1>

The concept is to build a robot that is also symbolic of a common practice, in this case a light-hearted jab at toilet humour. The T-Bot 2 Series will hopefully be a convincing enough metaphor for this concept. The first part of the robot – the articulated shoulder and sprocket joint, elbow, arm, and pivot-swing support – have been modelled to resemble the mechanism found within cisterns including the handle, support strut and pump. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide38.png "Conjoined Models with Articulation")

The joint of the reticulated arm created by first extending the length of the arm (in Vertex mode), then inserting an edge loop (Shift + Right Mouse Button; then select Insert Edge Loop) and pushing the edge back to create an elbow. Then extend the forearm vertices and taper using the scale tool. Finally add a sphere and deform its shape into that of an egg and attaching it to the elbow joint. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide39.png "Reticulation Modelling")

I added detail to the spherical joint by selecting faces on the sphere, circularize the selected faces, then begin extruding them inwards towards the joint, to create a suitable depression. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide40.png "Spherical Joints for Robotic Arm")

Arms have been mirrored by duplicating the original (left) assembly and reversing the scale in the Channel Box / Layer Editor pane. The body has been constructed from a cube with edge loops, warped vertices, and smoothening applied. Additional details and dents have been applied through a combination of tools under the Mesh, Edit Mesh, and Mesh Tools panes. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide41.png "Mirroring for Robot Body and Arms")

Likewise, the back of the robot has been provided with a similar anatomy to the front – the indentations at the front provide a consistent ripple effect throughout the back, creating the illusion of a bullet or projectile that has passed through the torso and has resulted in its shape, which is consequently not to mechanical or biological, but somewhere in between; a bionic construct. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide42.png "Backface and Frontface Anatomy")

Leg joints created and attached to the bottom section of the torso. For symmetry accuracy all assets were grouped accordingly (CTRL + G) then positioned by inserting values into the Channel Editor / Layer Settings numeric boxes to mirror each asset’s counter position. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide43.png "Torso and Hip Joints")

Through a few (actually many) YouTube tutorials I have (to some extent) figured out the bend deformer tool and its application to making assets like pipes, hoses, wiring etc. No toilet concept is complete without plumbing and the exercise to find, create and manipulate pipes will no doubt be a useful skill to learn for future modelling projects. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide44.png "Curves for Pipes and Hoses")

Toilet Robot (T-Bot 2 Series) model – replete with hose and air filter funnel – getting close to completion. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide45.png "Basic Robot Form")

The main torso has been modelled to look like the portable toilets one finds at construction sites and large public gatherings. The extra allusions have been added by way of the squatting posture, freed up arms for reading, and the coin slot at the back – all of which (hopefully) render the concept of the daily visit. A few future additions might include allusions to a magazine rack holder and a drain-like shape for increased association. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide46.png "Posture and Poise")

Additional textures have been added to the toilet robot, along the lines of the “Toilet Zone” look and feel. Here I have learned to apply nodes and chamfer vertices to create a more textured and asymmetrical look. Using the hypershade tool I have also managed to vary the vertex spacing and extrude depths to create imbalanced albedo levels across the model, which I believe will be useful for when I ultimately do a UV wrap and texture. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide47.png "Texture and Topology")

Further detailing done to the body of the model to create a diseased and leprosy-inducing look. This effect is achieved by chamfering individual faces and extruding / deforming each face to create the pimply, diseased-growth look. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide48.png "Deform Tools")

Further improvements to the robot were done here by isolating specific sections of the body and manipulating them through the basic command tools (bevel, extrude, bridge etc) and through the mirror tool where symmetry is required. The mirror tool was used to mirror along the objects mode rather than the world mode, since the robot’s position and construct is ever so slightly asymmetrical. Further refinements have been carried out to the front façade to increase the derelict quality of the robot and the scene it will operate in. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide49.png "Combination of Tools for Modelling Facade")

With the toilet bot nearing completion, the environment around it is under construction, in this case a modern water closet, complete with counter, sink, faucets, mugs, shelves, and towel rack. The robot standing to the side is in fact the cistern, which hopefully adds to the narrative tension of this scene. The walls, fixtures, and fittings for the structure were built using grid snaps, live interaction, and the list of common tools. I have also changed the background from flat grey to the default gradient since the scene is moving from a flat two-dimensional plane to a more three-dimensional construct. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide50.png "Environment Construction")

The colouring process with shaders – so far I have managed to apply blinn, phong, and materials and anisotropic shaders to the walls and fittings. The robot will come later. The shaders can be found under the Rendering shelf of the top toolbar in Maya. It is important to use the Outliner pane (left of the screen) to properly label all assets since the more shaders and details in a scene the more complex is the workflow and process management. After this stage will come Arnold. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide51.png "Shader Applications")

To copy-paste an existing object’s shader to apply to another object, right click the object that requires shading. From the corresponding dropdown menu, locate the Assign Existing Material option, and from the flyout tab choose the shader that has already been applied to the first object, for use on the latter. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide52.png "Shader Toolbars")

After finding a suitable image of a texture online, and importing it into Maya (in this case the flooring, which initially had a blinn applied to it, but after clicking on the checker box icon near the blinn, an image can be uploaded to Maya) the flooring is ready for UV wrapping / unwrapping. The thumbnail of the red and white carpet texture can be seen in the image above. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide53.png "Texture Mapping")

This is in UV editing mode (from the dropdown menu at the extreme top-right corner). Select UV Editing from the dropdown. The layout here shows the file that has been imported with corresponding UV values from 0 to 1. This UV Editing layout screen can also be reached from Windows > Modelling Editors > UV Editing. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide54.png "UV Mapping")

Here is the carpet texture that was imported from the last step. The texture can be brought up by clicking on the face / surface / object that the texture was uploaded and assigned to, from the previous step. The white inverted T is the UV wrapper, which is in fact the six sides of a completely wrapped cube. Note: the UV is a flattened-out version of the object that needs to be wrapped along a box model. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide55.png "Flattening Maps")

Clicking on the checker map button (the two buttons in line with the right of the UV box in image above) will bring up the UV checker screen with corresponding coordinates and values. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide56.png "UV Co-ordinate Values")

Of the six empty spaces in the inverted T, one of them contains the texture. To see which one, right-click the asset from the screen on the left (in this case the floor) and the UV layout on the right will highlight (in green) which space contains the texture. In almost all cases it is the third box from the top just before the horizontal bar of the T. If for any reason the texture is not showing up, as is the case here, click on the scene on the left, then press 6 on the number pad to bring up the texture view. Note that assigning the texture in this mode will do a complete UV wrap of the object. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide57.png "UV T-bar Mapping")

Assign a new UV by clicking on UV (from the top menu) then select planar in this case since the surface is flat. Consider the shape of the asset before assigning a cylindrical, spherical or planar UV. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide58.png "Assigning New UVs")

Selecting planar has assigned a brand new set of UVs to the flooring of this scene. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide59.png "Planar View")

Success! The carpet texture has been applied to the floor as a UV. In the next step I will download a painting to map onto a frame on the left wall, following the same procedure described above. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide60.png "UV Map Completed")

Here is a painting UV wrapped onto the face of simple cube that has been reshaped to become a frame. UV wrapping requires creating a new set of UVs to fit with the inverted T as described. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide61.png "UV Map of Painting")

The scene is coming along nicely now that UV wrapping has been added. In the following sections I will be adding shaders, textures, and UV wraps to the robot, which will likely be the most detailed (and rewarding in many ways) work of this project. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide62.png "UV Map of Environment")

In this scene I have added a proper carpet texture through the UV wrap tool and also created a wicker basket for added practice with UV tools, following the same procedure learned so far. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide63.png "UV Map of Wicker Basket")

<h1>Week 4: Weeks 1, 2, 3 + Full Scenes, Arnold, and Rendering</h1>

THE ROOM: Here is a new scene I am creating, from scratch, to apply everything learned so far. I have subscribed to a few tutorials on YouTube as well as Udemy (which is more structured) that teaches the basics of shading and UV wrapping using Maya 2017. I am using Maya 2018, but the tools are largely similar. I will be creating a low poly scene. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide64.PNG "Modeling a Room")

I have built the furniture in this office scene (chair, desk, laptop, mugs, books, picture frame, window, and whiteboard) using the techniques described in this document. I then applied a lambert shader to the two walls and set the colour. Shelf and desk with shaders (lambert, blinn, and phong) applied. Floor shader (blinn) applied with reflectivity added for rendering and lighting effects, which will follow in the next few steps. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide65.PNG "Shaders Applied")

Multiple shaders applied to different faces of the same object. The vertices, faces, and edges can all be manipulated individually for any action being carried out, from applying shaders to UV wrapping. I have even managed to allocate shaders to the window panels for added effect.![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide66.PNG "Lambert Values")

Shaders applied to all objects, including individual book pages, which carry the same lambert values, whereas the covers for each possess varying blinn shaders. The next few steps will be UV mapping, followed by lighting, then rendering using Maya’s inbuilt render as well as the Arnold rendering engine. Tip: to apply the same shader to other objects, right click on the object that requires shading, then holding down the right mouse button scroll down the menu to the Assign Existing Material option. From the flyout menu pick one of the shaders that has been already been applied. Throughout this process do not release the right mouse button. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide67.PNG "UV Wrapped Picture")

A UV wrap has been assigned to the picture hanging on the wall, in this case an image of Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. The UV wrap is done by first uploading an image to the sourceimage.exe file as this is where Maya looks for files. Then go to the UV Editing option from the dropdown menu on the top right. Identify the box from the inverted T which contains the face that will hold the image and assign the UV wrap. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide68.PNG "Phong Shaders")

 Window with see-through glass added using a phong shader with transparency. I played around with the sliders and settings. Maya does a good job generating the effects in real time. In this scene the glass has almost maximum transparency with moderate levels of reflectivity, specular colour and reflected colour applied. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide69.PNG "Transparency Settings")

Once the basic modelling is complete it is time to render. I have set up a camera by going to Create > Cameras > Camera. This generates a camera within the scene. Position the camera then go to the Panels option in the dedicated window bar and choose ‘Look Through Selected’. The scene is now being viewed through the camera that has just been created. Also click on the little icon that says Resolution Gate to view what the final output will look like, and what dimensions, in this case 960 by 540. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide70.PNG "Camera and Render Settings")

Choosing the camera’s Focal Length can alter the perception of the scene. In this example I played around with the values to find the best composition for this scene. To get to this window, click on ‘camera’ in the Outliner panel to the left, and make sure the Attribute Editor is active in the right panel. Tip: to avoid accidentally shifting the perspective and reconfiguring it, lock the camera’s settings by clicking on the little icon with the camera and lock symbol, located at the top of the dedicated window, under the View, Shading, Lighting, Show, Renderer, Panels bar. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide71.PNG "Camera Focal Length")

In this scene I have created a light (the first step towards final rendering) by going to Create > Lights > Point Light. Just like a polygon object, the light asset will be generated in the scene. View the effects of the lighting by clicking on the little icon with the bulb symbol, located at the top of the dedicated window, under the View, Shading, Lighting, Show, Renderer, Panels bar. Using the now familiar move / rotate / scale tools the light can be positioned and adjusted as required. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide72.PNG "Lighting a Scene")

View the shadows generated by the point light by clicking on the little icon with the sphere and shadow symbol, located at the top of the dedicated window, under the View, Shading, Lighting, Show, Renderer, Panels bar. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide73.PNG "Shadows and Casts")

In this example I have removed the point light and placed a spotlight with tweaked values for the cone angle, penumbra angle, drop off and shadows – all of which can be found in the Attribute Editor panel on the right. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide74.PNG "Tweaking Light Settings")

I have now started using Arnold lighting systems. In this case I have used the area lighting option from the Arnold top menu dropdown. This is the Arnold render window, which can be reached by clicking on the little icon with the scene clapper and eye in front of it, located just below the top menu of Maya. Each light can be hidden and shown separately to see individual effects by choosing the light in the Outliner panel and toggling the light on and off by using the H key. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide75.PNG "Arnold Light Settings")

Final mood setting for the scene has been set with a directional light and an Arnold area light. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide76.png "Directional Light")

Render settings set under Options > Render Settings, within the Arnold window itself. Bump up the Camera (AA) value to maximum, i.e. 10, then click the Render button, which is the scene clapper icon located at the top left of the Arnold window. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide77.png "Render Settings")

Final render in progress – the process may take several minutes, even on a powerful computer. The first render on my computer (Alienware 15.6 inch laptop running 32GB, 512GB SSD, 1080 Graphics Card, i7) took 2:23 minutes. I was unhappy with the first render owing to particles in the atmospheric lighting oculus and so I revisited the atmosphere settings, (Render Settings > Environment > Atmosphere) clicked on the link icon for atmosphere, and bumped up the samples from 5 to 33. The second and final render took 9:16 minutes. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide78.png "Arnold Render Settings")

But the results were much better, and the additional wait of just under 7 minutes was worth it. To save an image of this final render, first go to File > Save Image and click on the information box to the right of the Save Image option. Ensure that the Colour Managed Image radio option is checked to preserve gamma information. Click on Apply and Close. Then revisit File > Save Image and choose the format of your preference. Choose PSD, tiff or targa (to preserve alpha values) if you want to do post-modelling and post-rendering work in Photoshop. I saved my final image as a PSD and then again as a PNG. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide79.png "Second Render Process")

Here is my final image in PNG. This entire scene and all its assets have been built entirely from scratch in Maya. Four weeks ago, I had never opened or even touched any 3D modelling software, ever. So even though I hope to get better, I am rather happy with this outcome. This result is a matter of following what is being taught in the lectures (credit: Mike Williamson), doing plenty of practice and research, and asking all the stupid questions in the world to anyone who is willing to answer you. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide80.png "Final Environment Render Output")

The lighting from Arnold together with the texture and UV mapping on the furniture create this mysterious 1940s detective movie look, complete with the art nuevo chair and desk that characterised the 1960s. Moving further along the skewed time line, the introduction of the modern laptop bridges the scene with the contemporary era. I believe that games are narratives in their own respect and each scene ideally requires a degree of genre to reinforce gameplay across both the experience and the story. This is also the underpinning foundation for ludology.

<h1>Week 5: Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4 + Structures, Materials, and Narratives of Reality</h1>

THE ENERGY BUILDING: Here is a new scene I am creating, from scratch, to build on everything learned so far. The concept is to create a New York style building from the 1940s and add complex shapes that are from differing eras all the way through to the present and future. In this project I wanted to construct a typical New York 40s-era building, then give it a futuristic, self-sufficient urban energy generator. I have tried to increase the complexities of the model in this scene. Using extrudes and bevels together with chamfers and vertex points, I have managed to warp faces into custom shapes that I have then bridged using the Bridge tool with settings set to Smooth + Curve. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide81.png "Energy Building")

The generator wheel at the back of this energy-efficient building has multiple points in tandem protrusion – the kind one sees in wind turbines. This was achieved by adding divisions along the thickened perimeter of the wheel then pulling out each face in series with its counter divisions to get this symmetrical but non-aligned look, which is the principle behind turbines – they are not aligned deliberately to break even patterns of wind flow. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide82.png "Wheel and Hypershading")

THE APPLE: Here is a new scene I am creating, from scratch, to add more complexity to a simple object by using more tools in Maya. In this project I will try to create an apple using all the tools learned so far, together with a few new tools I have discovered from online tutorials, namely soft selection, hypershading and bump mapping. In this scene I have created the basic sphere which serves as the foundation for the apple. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide83.png "Basic Apple Sphere")

Double-clicking the move tool (white arrow in the left menu bar) brings up the Tool Settings menu. Scroll down to the bottom of the menu and click on the checkbox next to Soft Selection. The soft selection tool essentially creates a fall off for the amount of manipulation carried out on an object. Instead of just affecting one selected vertex point or edge, it also affects the points around it in varying degrees of force, shown by the coloured mesh lines. The fall off amount can be adjusted by using the sliders. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide84.png "Soft Selection Tool")

The soft selection has been applied to the top and bottom of the sphere to create the depression found at the poles of the apple. I have also selected random points along the sphere and used the scale tool (R) to adjust the symmetry of the sphere. It requires a few takes and pass-throughs (hint: the x-ray tool comes in handy) to get the ideal form. The resulting shape is much more like an apple. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide85.png "Applied Soft Selection to Poles")

Blinn applied to the shape to create some reflectivity and waxy appearance. Once the blinn has been applied, first set the texture for the object – in this case an apple skin made in Photoshop or acquired legally from an online source. Once the texture has been applied the specular highlights can be adjusted to get the shine required. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide86.png "Blinn Shader Applied")

The green apple skin texture has been applied to the shape and already there is a fairly realistic model. The next step is to adjust the specular highlights, lighting and angle. A stem will also be added to the model and adjusted accordingly. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide87.png "Texture Mapping Applied")

A cylinder has been added to the scene, which will then be adjusted to create the stem for the apple using the tools found under the Edit Mesh panel. Since stems are seldom perfectly straight or symmetrical, the use of the extrude, bevel and bridge tools will come in handy. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide88.png "Stem Applied")

The cylinder by default has 20 sub-divisions. This makes it hard to select all the faces. Under the Channel Box / Layer Editor panel, click on the poly shape to bring up the settings. Then slide the number of divisions down to a more reasonable number – in this case 9. These sub-divisions can always be amended later in the same tools panel once the shape is finalised. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide89.png "Stem Shaped")

Final shape of stem is in place. The shape of the stem was achieved through extruding the face multiple times, and in each step I tilted the face to create the bending look. In the final extrusion I selected the edge and scaled it up to create the tapering stem look found on most apples. All of these tools can be found in the Edit Mesh tool panel. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide90.png "Final Stem Shaped")

A lambert shader has been applied to the stem and a bump map has been applied to the sphere. The bump map can be found under the Colour section of the blinn / lambert section in the Attribute Editor. The default value of the bump map makes the apple look shrivelled and old, which has its own benefits depending on what the aim of the scene is. In this case I want the apple to look a few days old – neither too fresh nor too decayed. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide91.png "Shrivelled Apple Form")

Under the bump tab there is a Bump Depth slider that when adjusted provides fine control over the amount of bumping / texturing on the object. Through trial and error, I found that a value of -0.020 works well for the type and age of apple I want to create. For an orange the bump value will be higher since the orange skin is more texturized. I also applied a bump map to the stem of the apple to create a more gnarled look. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide92.png "Ripe Apple Form")

Using the Arnold Renderer to render the final scene, learned from the previous project with the room. Because the shape and assets are simpler the same render quality settings results in a much faster render of 0:21 (21 seconds). Directional lighting and area lighting were used here (refer to the Room project) to provide additional depth to the final image. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide93.png "Rendering Final Output")

The final render of the apple. From sphere to apple the process becomes more familiar as I practice creating different scenes with ever-increasing complexities. It is amazing how the same tools used for creating simple shapes are constantly utilised (and fine-tuned) to create more advanced projects. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide94.png "Final Render")

<h3>Writing Shaders: Integrating Modelling with Programming</h3>

Game engines only draw triangles; the GPU does only one thing, which is to draw these triangles. Programmers decide the position of these triangles, and their colours, using shaders. In Unity, there is a shader gallery. A CG shader is a custom shader where all the lighting is controlled, whereas an albedo shader provides more control. When creating effects use an albedo shader; when creating post-effects, it's better to use a CG shader.

Shaders can be used for a variety of purposes, without writing a single line of code. They do not use any JPEGS on PNGS. Everything is procedurally generated when using shaders. A good example to see shaders in action is the website: glslsandbox.com/e GLSL is what runs on mobile phones, chrome cast, televisions etc. GLSL shaders can also be written in Blender and Unity, to design effects. The website holds an older version but is useful to understand how shaders work in a procedural method when applying these to objects and games assets.

Each scene contains nodes, which contain a matrix (as well as child nodes). Attached to these nodes are geometries that can be adjusted as required. When dealing with nodes, note that these nodes refer to geometry (triangles). Uniforms are materials that are same for the entire model that is being created. Clara.io is a web-based 3D modelling tool with plenty of shader options, and uses nodes to draw each scene.

The triangles in the FBX model go through a vertex shader, which provides the opportunity to move things around by (1) scaling or rotating, and (2) perspective transform, which makes objects look closer or farther away by dividing across the distance. The three corners of the triangle are fed to the rasterizer to create fragments. The rasterizer decides which pixels are included in the triangle. The fragment shader chooses a colour. The depth buffer figures out if the object can be drawn, and the frame buffer holds the colours. Fragments and pixels are used during anti-aliasing for multisampling. Mobile GPUs are optimised for multisampling, in which case having smooth edges on triangles requires fragments inside the pixel. In films, each pixel is run 500 times during multisampling, as opposed to about 8 times for mobile phones.

Geometry essentially is a set of triangles created in 3D software, then exported in FBX files. Normals are an essential part of this geometry. A bi-normal is added during bump mapping and UV mapping. Normals can also be baked into attributes, to create maps that blend into textures. For example, a map can be of a forest, and another map used as a path through the forest. Both these maps can be blended with each other to create smoother integration. Note that maps are bigger than attributes and should be managed accordingly. Two textures can be multiplied together to cover an repeats in the texture or map. Vertex attributes and custom maps are then fed into the shader.

Vertex shaders allow changes in shape, position or rotation of the geometry. Without a vertex shader, the geometry of modelled objects will always be at (0,0,0) and therefore will not move relative to the camera. Vertex shaders are used to step the objects around. Instancing is used to render a model several times over with slight changes in characteristics. Therefore an army of elves, for example, can be created by using just one instance of the elf, with minor attributes changed. UV co-ordinates can be transformed to animate the textures. Vertex shaders can be used to change the UV co-ordinates. Vertex shaders are also the only place where the size or shape of the object can be changed. Vertex shaders are mostly about shape.

Fragment shaders decide which colours to draw, and also the depth used in each colour. Multiple colour buffers allow for the creation of additional effects. A fragment shader can be used to create a plane that separate dark and light sparkles, for example. The plane then sweeps through the scene and changes one sparkle type to another. The same effect can be used for the effect of changing wireframes to fully-detailed models.

Lighting is also done using fragment shaders. Reflection maps and probes are used more commonly to create additional interest. The normal is just used to turn the reflection vector into a cube map, which can then used to create a diffused, specular map, for example, which creates a lighted effect. The opposite procedure can be used to turn a room dark. Dot products are used to calculate light intensity. This is illustrated in the example of a racing car with the roof reflecting the sky. The reality is that the map is used across the entire scene and lit up at certain camera angles to the normal.

Physically-based rendering mimics the way that rendering occurs in films. However, due to computational limits, PBR is seldom used in games owing to time and materials constraints. In games, PBR mostly refers to using reflection probes and environment maps for diffused and specular shading. Disney, for example, produces more games than any other studio. A paper out of Disney addressed this issue of PBR and its applications (limited in scope by the current state of technology) from films to games. Physically-based games essentially refers to blended compositions of parameters such as reflection maps.

Diffuse shading is the reflection from a rough surface, whereas specular shading is the reflection from a shinier surface. Both characteristics are used in 3D modelling software. Ambient occlusion refers to the corners of a room or quadrant. Ambient occulsions look for corners in the depth map and shades them darker than elsewhere in the room. Ambient occlusion is often confused with the edges of objects but works well for the human eye since these minute differences are not very easily spotted. All three options are available in Blender, Maya, 3D Max, Unreal Engine, and other industry-level 3D modelling software and games engines. Distance maps are a very handy way of working out full ambient occlusion. A distance map is a voxel of the entire room, which then uses rays to very quickly determine ambient occlusion.

Shadows in games engines are used in a particular way: the camera is used to determine how the light itself can become a shadow. The light source, from the point of view of the camera, tells a player which parts of the object will have positive lights, and which will have negative lights, or shadows. This is why walls in a game need a critical thickness, so that the shadow asset does not pass through it but stays on it. As a general rule, chamferring is a good way to overcome many shadow issues. Z-buffers are a bunch of numbers that state how far a triangle is from another. The Z-buffer determines this order and decides which ones to affect, based on the shape required.

Tesselation shaders are another option to create smooth surfaces. However, geometry shaders allow for the creation of further points, which is not possible in vertex shaders. But mostly the games industries use vertex and fragment shaders. Tesselation shaders are also used for nurbs curves and smoother geometry, but games still tend to choose triangles owing to its flexibility.

Compute shaders are used to calculate processes between shader creation cycles, and are most often used for film production and post-processing. These are useful for tracking detailed changes during the shader creation process.

<h1>Week 6: Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4 + 5 + More Narratives of Reality</h1>

THE CERAMIC STRAWBERRY STATUE: Here is a new scene I am creating, from scratch, to add to the previous two projects. In this project I am going to try to model a ceramic strawberry counter ornament based on everything I have learned so far. To start off I have created a sphere and then by double-clicking on the move tool (white arrow) I clicked on the Drag select radio option box. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide95.png "Ceramic Strawberry")

Here is the basic elongated sphere of the strawberry’s shape. The sphere was elongated using the scale tool (R) and the highlighted section of the mesh was selected using the drag tool as described in the step above. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide96.png "Ceramic Strawberry Basic Shape")

Hitting the shortcut key B brings up the soft selection option as shown in the image above. The soft selection description, function and usage processes are outlined in the previous project on modelling an apple. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide97.png "Soft Selection")

The overall shape has been fixed and the vertices and edges at the top of the strawberry have been ranged and pitted using a combination of points and toggling between scale and movement using soft selection and the drag tools to create the rippled effect out of which the strawberry leaf will come. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide98.png "Ranging and Pitching")

With all the current (straight) edges selected, go to Create > Sets > Quick Select Set and create a new set for these edges. Call it anything. I called my set Straight-Edges. The reason for Quick Select Sets is to create a specifically selectable group that can later be easily isolated when intermingled with other edges, faces, vertices etc. Later these straight edges will need to be removed to create the dimples in the strawberry. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide99.png "Quick Selection Set")

To create the dimpled effect of the strawberry I selected all the faces of the object by clicking and dragging over the model then went to Edit Mesh > Poke. This creates interstices across the faces of the model. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide100.png "Dimpling")

Only the new criss-crossed edges that resulted from the Poke tool are required. Therefore, the straight edges need to be deleted. Since selecting each straight edge would be incredibly time-consuming, the fast and easy way is to select the Straight Edge set created earlier using the Quick Select Set tool. Go to Select > Quick Select Sets > Straight-Edges to select just that group of edges. Then go to Edit Mesh > Delete Edge / Vertex. What is left behind are the criss-cross edges, as required. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide101.png "Poke Tool")

Here I have created a Quick Select Set for all the chamfered faces that will become the pits for the strawberry, called Pits. These individual faces can be achieved in several ways. I bevelled the faces of the entire strawberry, then chamfered the vertices to create these individual and somewhat evenly distributed face markers across the shape. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide102.png "Chamfering")

Go to Edit Mesh > Extrude and push the selected faces (Pits). Pressing G while in Extrude mode will create another extrusion layer. I created three additional extrusions to create this multi-layered pitted effect. Play around with the number of extrusions to get a feel of how much is too much and what feels just right. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide103.png "Pitting Completed")

When the shape feels satisfactory it is time to add a new texture. Right click on the object and scroll down to Assign New Material. I added a blinn to this object and changed the colour to a simple red as shown in the next image. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide104.png "Blinn Applied")

The blinn has been applied and a red colour assigned that matches a strawberry hue. At this stage, where refined selection is required the use of the Quick Select Sets tool is invaluable for efficient workflow and processes. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide105.png "Colour Hue Applied")

Here the pits have been selected using the previously-created Quick Select Sets tool. I have applied a blinn to the pits and stained them with a slight orange for greater contrast since the organic fruit has darker pitted stains whereas with ceramic the pit details tend to reflect more. The object is starting to look more like a strawberry, especially when it is scaled down. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide106.png "Shader Applied to Pits")

In this step the stem is inserted. Create a simple cylinder and drag it to the top centre of the strawberry, where the wrinkles curve down towards the centre, just like in a real strawberry. Ceramic objects usually have more linear wrinkles owing to the material and so I have deepened the grooves at the top where the leaf comes out from. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide107.png "Stem Created")

Select and delete the bottom and side faces of the cylinder so that what is left is a flat plane. Using the drag select tool is extremely handy for this process. Since this is intended to be a ceramic object, I have included a seam across the upper-middle section of the object to show where the kiln connection would have been during the firing stage. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide108.png "Flat Top")

With the flat plane selected, hit 3 to add divisions and round off the cylinder. Then go to Edges, click on the outermost edge and using the move tool, fold the edge down and over the strawberry to create the umbrella-like dome. Do this for a few of the edges towards the outer circumferences of the cylinder plane. Then switch to Vertex mode and select the centre vertex of the plane. Using the move tool push down the vertex to create a depression. Essentially just play around with the shape until it feels right. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide109.png "Cover Lid")

Once the shape is finalised, pick an image as a UV texture – in this case I have used an image of mint leaves – to act as the top stem of the strawberry. Apply the UV map as detailed in the previous projects (Rooms and Apple). Use the UV Shell select option to move and scale the UV shell over the texture image to achieve a satisfactory result. Duplicate the texture to create more interest. Because this is a fired ceramic object, no bump map has been used. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide110.png "UV Map on Lid")

I played around with the lights to see if I could create a more ceramic effect instead of an organic fruit look. In this project I wanted to create fruit furniture as a combined practice between the furniture in the Rooms project and the fruit in the Apple project. By adjusting lighting and blinn effects I was able to create this ceramic-looking strawberry statue. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide111.png "Lighting and Rendering")

Here is the final render of the organic strawberry ornament. The inclusion of the kiln seam towards the upper-middle of the object deliberately gives it a manufactured look. I initially thought I could achieve the dull, glassy effect of fired ceramic using only lighting, but over the course of this project I have learned that when it comes to materials, the formation of textures requires that every stage, from the basic skeleton right through to the final lighting requires as realistic a treatment as possible. The final result can be used as either a stool or an urn or jar. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/images-weeks-1-5/Slide112.png "Final Render")

Here is another final render, this time of a barbecue stove. This barbecue stove model was made using the same principles for materials and texture realism as in the strawberry ceramic jar section, then further refined to imbue the model with its own characteristics. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/images-weeks-6-10/BBQ-Stove.jpg "Final Render")

Likewise, the following images of a paint can, and a chair, were all carried out in a similar fashion. It is important to note that while each model requires its own set of attributes and characteristics, the methods and approach to modelling remain consistent across projects. Organising workflows, regardless of the object itself being modelled, is of paramount importance, especially when moving out of Maya's environment and into external programmes such as ZBrush and Substance Painter. Here is the final render of the paint can. 
![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/images-weeks-6-10/Paint-Can.jpg "Final Render")

Following the methods and approaches used in the Introduction to Modelling course helps clarify these approaches by offering a consistent way of thinking and performing. For the chair, I started out just like the previous projects - to first understand the form of the chair in as few strokes and elements as possible. From there, every additional stroke is an embellishment designed to reinforce, but not create, greater realism and model integrity. Here is the final render of the chair. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/images-weeks-6-10/Chair.jpg "Final Render")

<h1>Week 7: Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4 + 5 + 6 Complete and Complex Scene Modelling</h1>

THE AUTHOR’S CABIN: Here is a new scene I am creating, from scratch, to add to the previous projects so far. In this project I am going to try to model an old, cabin desk reminiscent of a writing room from the 18th century. Inspiration, tutorials, and references for this scene are from Udemy tutorials, YouTube videos, and two books. All sources have been referenced at the end of the page. The Mesh tool has everything for object manipulation. The Edit Mesh tool has everything for component manipulation. The Mesh tool performs different functions for modelling and fine-tuning. The Mesh Display tool has everything to do with normals and vertices – how the object looks. Curves tool contains nurbs manipulation. The Surface tool is used to create nurbs surfaces, then polygons from them. The Deform tool can be applied to change the shape of objects in Maya. The Generate creates lots of geometry for a vast-view scene. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/images-weeks-6-10/Slide113.png "Started New Scene of Cabin")

To select entire parallel edges, click on one edge, then SHIFT + Double Click on an adjacent edge to select the entire ring of edges, which can then be manipulated, eg extrude or collapse. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/images-weeks-6-10/Slide114.png "Beginning With Cubes")

To grow or contract a selection, hold down SHIFT + > to grow the selection, and SHIFT + < to contract the selection. This works for all selection types, i.e. faces, edges, vertices. This is critically important to have proper topology for the model to shape adequately. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/images-weeks-6-10/Slide115.png "Edge Contractions")

All authors use candles in one form or another in their writing, from basic lighting in the past, to religious and superstitious reasons. Here I have reshaped the cube into a candle using a combination of the basic tools together with soft selection (hit B) and the Crease Tool (select an edge, then hold SHIFT + Right Mouse Button to bring up the Crease Tool, then use the middle mouse button to drag and shape. More crease tool applications will result in the dripping wax look. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/images-weeks-6-10/Slide116.png "Candle With Wick")

In addition to the candle, I am also building out a book. A basic cube has been manipulated using the Extrude and Scale tools to create the rough shape of the book. The pages or inserts in books from the 18th century are always smaller than the hardback cover. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/images-weeks-6-10/Slide117.png "Book Shape")

Multiple edge loops have been created along the insert using the Insert Edge Loop tool options. These will be manipulated to give the spine of the book a rounder look and therefore a more realistic feel. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/images-weeks-6-10/Slide118.png "Basic Book Form")

The spine has been rounded by first selecting the four centre vertices along the edge view of the book. Then holding B and dragging the mouse outward, the appropriate vertex points have been assigned to the soft selection tool. Then use the move tool to pull the selection outward. However, the bend is not following through all the way to the edges. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/images-weeks-6-10/Slide119.png "Book Spine")

The lattice tool is a better option. Bring up the lattice tool by first selecting Deform > Lattice and clicking on the options box. Then reduce the number of divisions (by default Maya applies a specific division count) to just one in the middle. Select the lattice points on both sides of the spine (far end and near end) then use the move tool to push these out. The lattice tool will attempt to preserve the shape of the cube, thus creating a sharp point. To create a smooth curve, go to the Attribute Editor, select the lattice tool tab (ffd1) and turn off the local check box. The lattice protrusion will now follow a smooth curve as shown in the image above. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/images-weeks-6-10/Slide120.png "Lattice Tool")

Old books were hand-cut, which meant visible imperfections along the page edges. This effect can be achieved in Maya using the Transform tool found under the Edit Mesh panel. Increasing the Random value in the Channel Box / Layout Editor will increase the random distribution of force applied to each vertex. Ensure that vertex mode is selected. Then use the move tool to drag out the selected vertex points. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/images-weeks-6-10/Slide121.png "Imperfection")

Here the transform component tool has been applied the vertices along the page edge and pulled in different directions at varying forces to create a rougher, hand-cut look for the book. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/images-weeks-6-10/Slide122.png "Rough Cuts")

Mild transform / randomness has also been applied to the top wrapping cover of the book, since this is the area that takes the brunt of any impact when a book falls or is forced into a shelf space that is too small for it. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/images-weeks-6-10/Slide123.png "Corner Damage")

In this scene the book’s edges have been bevelled and segmented, and the top and bottom edges of the spine, which hold the inserts between them, have been creased with hardened edges applied. The result is a much more convincing 18th century tomb, than the more modern looking dictionary-type volume in the image immediately preceding this one. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/images-weeks-6-10/Slide124.png "Applied Bevels and Segmentation")

Randomness has also been added to the creasing along the leading and trailing edges of the book bind for greater visual detail. This was achieved using the crease tool, then creating a few edge loops and applying random soft and hard edges to each loop. Slight extrusion and movement were also used to fine-tune the effect. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/images-weeks-6-10/Slide125.png "Applied Bevels and Segmentation")

For further refinement I have created this dented book corner, a common feature found on old books. This effect was achieved by first creating random edge loops around the area, then selecting all the vertex points at the corner and averaging them out. The result is a dented look that adds a touch more accuracy to the scene. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/images-weeks-6-10/Slide126.png "Corner Dents")

Similar effects have been applied to the candle to achieve the convoluted shape that candles adopt when burnt over extended periods. I will add the dripping wax to the candle at a later stage. For now, the deformities and imperfections achieved on the book have also been applied to the candle to evoke the basic feelings of use and agedness. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/images-weeks-6-10/Slide127.png "Candle Aging Look")

Another book has been created using the same techniques. This latest book, sitting atop the earlier one, had chamfers and averages for its vertices applied – both along its spine and edges, and across its pages. The result is a more hand-bound feel, which will hopefully come through more at later stages of its development, especially during UV wraps and lighting. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/images-weeks-6-10/Slide128.png "More Books")

This candle holder was created from a cylinder with edge loops placed evenly across to provide additional extrusions, bevels, and protrusions. I used a CV curve to draw the primary handle, and the bridge tool to create the small secondary clutch at the base of the candle holder. The CV curve tool is proving extremely useful. To access the CV curve, go to Create > Curve Tools > CV Curve Tool. Draw the curve along the points required. In this case I drew the curve starting from the base of the candle holder. When I was happy with the shape, after adjusting the curve points, I selected two faces at the base of the holder where the curve made contact, together with the curve, then applied the Extrude tool. Finer adjustments were then carried out with the scale, chamfer, and move tool. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/images-weeks-6-10/Slide129.png "Candle Holder")

The candle holder is ready after lots of minor tweaks and tugs at the faces, edges, and the curve that forms the handle. The candle requires more work but its position on the candle holder works well and the scene is coming together quite nicely. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/images-weeks-6-10/Slide130.png "Candle and Candle Holder")

For more refined work on the candle – the melted wax and uneven burn drips – the sculpting tool is extremely handy. To get to the sculpting tool, click on the Sculpting tab on the top menu bar, then choose any of the orange and white tools. I began by selecting the first one, called the Sculpt Tool. Double-clicking on the same tool’s icon in the left pane brings up the tools options and controls, which I will be using to sculpt the faces of the candle. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/images-weeks-6-10/Slide131.png "Waxy Look")

I have created a flame for the candle using the create polygon tool, located under Mesh Tools. The tool acts like the pen tool found on image manipulation software. I drew the shape of the flame using the tool’s points, then positioned the flame on top of the candle wick using the common move tools. It also helps to switch between front and perspective view for accurate placement of assets in the scene. Clicking Alt + B cycles through different backgrounds of the screen. It makes it easier to see and isolate specific items. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/images-weeks-6-10/Slide132.png "Candle Flame")

I am learning to use the nParticle tool to create the candle wax drip effect. First, switch from Modelling to Fx in the dropdown menu at the top left. A new set of top level menu options will come up. Click on nParticles, then from the dropdown menu go to Create Options > Water. This will ensure a nice blobby look. Go back to nParticles, then from the dropdown menu go to nParticle Tool. The accompanying tool pane on the right provides fine control over the distribution and spread of the particles. Click and draw around the object with the mouse – though a tablet works much better. Once done, press Enter to commit the tool application. Then, from the top level menu (still in Fx) click on Modify > Convert > nParticle to Polygons. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/images-weeks-6-10/Slide133.png "nParticles Wax")

Here is another set of nParticles, used for the wax that drips and accumulates at the base of candle holders. It is important to remember to delete the history of the nSurface polygon history (Channel Box > Edit > Delete History) to leave on the pure polygon behind, and not additional asset data types that unnecessarily take up space. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/images-weeks-6-10/Slide134.png "nParticles Drippings")

In creating a pen for the scene I am using a CV curve to draw the basic shape in, using an image of a pen as a reference. I then used the Surface > Revolve Options menu to create a span curve that wrapped itself around a flat planar to pipe polygon. This created the body of the pen that will go into the scene. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/images-weeks-6-10/Slide135.png "CV Curves for Quill Pen")

Here is the pen complete with a nib, hole for ink, and a curved stem for where the quill feather will come. I am learning how to use lofted curves to create a feather-like quill that goes around the main curve of the pen. The CV curve has been used in this scene a few times with good results. I am also continuing to add detail to the rest of the object(s) using all the tools – basic and intermediate – that I have learned so far. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/images-weeks-6-10/Slide136.png "Quill Pen Base")

Begin by drawing two separate CV curves around the stem of the pen. Then, go to Surfaces > Loft (tool options) and set the parameters to Quad and General with span for initial tessellation controls. Once the Loft has been created, go to the Channel Box / Layout Editor and adjust the nurbs tessellate polygon count to approximately 450 for a roughly even distribution of faces. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/images-weeks-6-10/Slide137.png "Loft Tool")

The result of the steps above is a neat mesh that can now be edited and texture-mapped to provide the quill feather effect. The Loft curve is yet another new concept but I am understanding how it works and what its applications are to the overall concept of modelling. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/images-weeks-6-10/Slide138.png "Loft Tool")

All my assets for this scene are ready. Additional fine-tuning will continue as this scene progresses. But the next major stage of the workflow is UV mapping for each of the components of all of the assets. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/images-weeks-6-10/Slide139.png "All Assets Completed")

The first book has been fully UV wrapped. In some cases where the spine and part of the covers had additional faces, each had to be UV wrapped individually. In these instances I took the opportunity to wrap similar textures with small differences to add to the hand-bound feel. The book has been wrapped in a leather texture with faces deliberately jutting out (from the modelling stage) to show that the cover is coming loose, as it often does with very old books. This book used a combination of blinn and lambert shaders together with textures. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/images-weeks-6-10/Slide140.png "Book UV Wrapping")

Scene setup is more or less completed. I experimented with the camera perspective in order to find the best angle in which to frame the scene. Once settled the camera can be locked into place and then lighting can begin. The quill, candle holder, candle, and desk will each be UV wrapped in succession before any lighting begins. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/images-weeks-6-10/Slide141.png "Further Book UV Wrapping and Camera Setup")

I have added a piece of paper and used the Bend Deform Tool to give it a natural page curl. To achieve this effect, create a plane and scale it up as required. Then go to the Deform tool panel at the top, and choose Nonlinear, then Bend. Use the bend tool panel on the right to adjust the amount of bend, in my scene I set a value of 20. Then, use the rotate tool (E) to twist and bend the paper along an axis as desired. This paper fits well with the scene and will get its own UV wrap as well. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/images-weeks-6-10/Slide142.png "Parchment")

At this stage I am trying to balance lighting with UV wrap to ensure that neither overwhelms the other or interferes with the overall look and feel of the scene. I am testing the scene with spot lights, directional lights and pinpoint lights (for the candle and flame) to get an idea of how a wintry writer’s task would appear. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/images-weeks-6-10/Slide143.png "Wintry Scene Lighting")

In this stage I have learned, from a Udemy Tutorial, to add an image plane and assign an image to it. The image is that of a forest through a window, deliberately positioned to cut most of its detail away, leaving little more than a sliver of a dusty window. I have also learned to use the Color Gain tool to manipulate the look and feel of the image plane to match with the scene I have in mind. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-Modelling-Repo/blob/master/images-weeks-6-10/Slide144.png "Image Plane")
